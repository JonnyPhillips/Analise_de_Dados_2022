abstract = {This paper explores the relationship between school choice and housing price as well as residential sorting using school choice reform in the Seoul metropolitan area. With the newly implemented choice program, students are able to choose high schools outside as well as within their school districts. I estimate hedonic models using boundary fixed approach and panel fixed approach together. With sales price, rental price and advertised price of apartments as dependent variables, the findings consistently reveal that school choice reform reduces housing prices in a high-performing school district relative to the housing prices in a low-performing school district by approximately 10–27{\%}. In addition, after reform, people in a high-performing school district are more likely to outmigrate to other communities compared to one in a low-performing school district. This implies that school choice could have unintended consequences driven by change in housing price and student composition.},

This exercise results in a number of clear pre- scriptions for the analysis of politics and institutional change: disaggregate institutions into schemas and resources; decompose institutional durability into processes of reproduction, disruption, and response to disruption; and, above all, appreciate the multiplicity and heterogeneity of the institutions that make up the social world. Recent empirical work on identities, interests, alternatives, and political innovation illustrates how political scientists and sociologists have begun to document the consequences of institutional con- tradiction and multiplicity and to trace the workings of institutional contain- ment, diffusion, and mediation},

abstract = {This article presents a new methodology for multilevel analysis using a small number of cases, named Comparative Multilevel Analysis (CMA). A classic problem in comparative studies has been the presence of too many variables and too few cases. One traditional solution to this problem has been to study subsystems within a system. However, the approach has fundamental limitations: it cannot analyse subsystems from different contexts, nor can it determine how conditions on the system level influence subsystems. By proposing four additions to traditional methodology, this article offers a new method of comparing subsystems from different contexts in order to analyse the effect of context on subsystems. The author also illustrates how CMA can be combined with Qualitative Comparative Analysis and Fuzzy-set, thereby enabling these methods to be used in the study of subsystem and context effects.},

Firms with public procurement revenue substantially increase tunneling around regional elections, whereas neither the tunneling activity of firms without procurement revenue, nor the legitimate financial activity of firms exhibits a pronounced political cycle. We show that the correlation between tunneling around elections and procurement contacts across firms is an indicator of corruption. We use the variation in the strength of this correlation to build a locality-level measure of corruption. Using this measure, we test and reject the “efficient grease” hypothesis by showing that in more corrupt localities procurement contracts are allocated to less productive firms},

Given the difficulty of calculating the relationship between school quality and student outcomes, I turn to another method and use house prices to infer the value parents place on school quality. I look within school districts at houses located on attendance district boundaries; houses then differ only by the elementary school the child attends. I thereby effectively remove the variation in neighborhoods, taxes, and school spending. I find that parents are willing to pay 2.5 percent more for a 5 percent increase in test scores. This finding is robust to a number of sensitivity checks.},

abstract = {In democratic elections, candidates and parties promise to deliver public goods to segments of the electorate in order to win their support at the polls. In new democracies, especially in rural agrarian societies, existing networks of clientelist politics can alter this logic, so that candidates instead promise private goods to patrons in return for those rural patrons delivering the votes of their clients. This suggests that in such regimes, the distribution of public goods spending by the government should vary inversely with the strength of clientelist networks. Specifically, we propose that the strength of patron-client ties varies according to whether peasants farm as smallholders, sharecroppers, fixed rent tenants, or landless laborers. Accordingly, the strength of rural patrons should vary across districts with the distribution of households among various land tenure categories. Our theory then suggests that where land tenure patterns render rural patrons weaker, elected governments should invest more resources in public goods in order to win the votes of peasants. Where land tenure patterns give patrons more control over peasant farmers, government spending on public goods should be lower because candidates and parties have to devote more resources to private benefits to the patrons. We test this proposition with district level data from Nepal on the patterns of land tenure and on the provision of public goods.},

abstract = {Despite the fact that critical junctures are frequently deployed in historical analyses, we lack an explicit causal logic for them. This article proposes a distinction between permissive and productive conditions in critical junctures. Permissive conditions are necessary conditions that mark the loosening of constraints on agency or contingency and thus provide the temporal bounds on critical junctures. Productive conditions, which can take various logical forms, act within the context of these permissive conditions to produce divergence. I develop these concepts in detail and use classic analyses that apply the concept to show the implications of this new framework for the scope conditions, case selection, and theoretical completeness of historical analysis, as well as for broader issues in historical analysis such as the relationships between crisis and outcome, and between stability and change.},

abstract = {Segregation involves more than one population group, and segregation measures quantify how different population groups are distributed across space. One of the key conceptual and methodological foundations of segregation studies is to account for the potential of spatial interaction among two or more population groups across areal units. This foundation implies the need for a spatial approach to portray the spatial (and thus social) interaction among neighbors. In general, simple percentages (for example, percent Black) are not a measure of segregation. Because local spatial segregation measures did not emerge until recently, the objectives of this article are threefold: (1) to explain a spatial approach for measuring the level of segregation at the neighborhood (or local) level, (2) to demonstrate the deficiencies of using a percentage of racial/ethnic group as a measure of segregation, and (3) to clarify the appropriateness of two commonly used indexes of dissimilarity and diversity. Data from St. Louis, Missouri, and Chicago, Illinois, are used to discuss these three points.},

Although hailed by many as an unqualified success, its political dimensions have been largely ignored or underplayed. These include, for example, the unashamed use of Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia for electoral purposes, the spread of clientelism and patronage, and the growing dependence of Brazil's poor on income transfers rather than productive employment. Furthermore, there are indications that the popularity of Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia is encouraging short-termism in social policy. Many Brazilian policy makers now seem to view the program as mainstream social policy rather than as a temporary measure-a perspective that could undermine longer-term investments in key areas such as health and basic education.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of income inequality as measured by the Robin Hood index and the Gini coefficient on all cause and cause specific mortality in the United States.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nDESIGN: Cross sectional ecological study.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nSETTING: Households in the United States.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease specific mortality, income, household size, poverty, and smoking rates for each state.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: The Robin Hood index was positively correlated with total mortality adjusted for age (r = 0.54; P {\textless}0.05). This association remained after adjustment for poverty (P {\textless}0.007), where each percentage increase in the index was associated with' an increase in the total mortality of 21.68 deaths per 100,000. Effects of the index were also found for infant mortality (P = 0.013); coronary heart disease (P = 0.004); malignant neoplasms (P = 0.023); and homicide (P {\textless}0.001). Strong associations were also found between the index and causes of death amenable to medical intervention. The Gini coefficient showed very little correlation with any of the causes of death.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSION: Variations between states in the inequality of income were associated with increased mortality from several causes. The size of the gap between the wealthy and less well off--as distinct from the absolute standard of living enjoyed by the poor--seems to matter in its own right. The findings suggest that policies that deal with the growing inequities in income distribution may have an important impact on the health of the population.},

abstract = {In the regression-discontinuity (RD) design, units are assigned to treatment based on whether their value of an observed covariate exceeds a known cutoff. In this design, local polynomial estimators are now routinely employed to construct confidence intervals for treatment effects. The performance of these confidence intervals in applications, however, may be seriously hampered by their sensitivity to the specific bandwidth employed. Available bandwidth selectors typically yield a “large” bandwidth, leading to data-driven confidence intervals that may be biased, with empirical coverage well below their nominal target. We propose new theory-based, more robust confidence interval estimators for average treatment effects at the cutoff in sharp RD, sharp kink RD, fuzzy RD, and fuzzy kink RD designs. Our proposed confidence intervals are constructed using a bias-corrected RD estimator together with a novel standard error estimator. For practical implementation, we discuss mean squared error optimal bandwidths, which are by construction not valid for conventional confidence intervals but are valid with our robust approach, and consistent standard error estimators based on our new variance formulas. In a special case of practical interest, our procedure amounts to running a quadratic instead of a linear local regression. More generally, our results give a formal justification to simple inference procedures based on increasing the order of the local polynomial estimator employed. We find in a simulation study that our confidence intervals exhibit close-to-correct empirical coverage and good empirical interval length on average, remarkably improving upon the alternatives available in the literature. All results are readily available in R and STATA using our companion software packages described in Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014d, 2014b).},

abstract = {Objective We studied the prevalence of weight excess and short stature among school-age children in Chile over the past decade.Methods We designed a descriptive cross-sectional, school-based study to analyze nutritional and stature trends in prepubertal and pubertal boys and girls from 1986 to 1998.Results Between 1986 and 1998, we detected significant increases in obesity risk (body mass index between the 85th and 95th percentiles): from 8.3{\%} to 19.6{\%} in prepubertal males, from 5.4{\%} to 14.6{\%} in pubertal males, from 10.2{\%} to 16.2{\%} in prepubertal females, and from 9.7{\%} to 24.9{\%} in pubertal females. Obesity (body mass index {\textgreater}95th percentile) increased significantly, from 4.3{\%} to 29.5{\%} in prepubertal males, from 1.6{\%} to 14.6{\%} in pubertal, from 4.7{\%} to 24.0{\%} in prepubertal females, and from 2.3{\%} to 17.6{\%} in pubertal females. During this same period, the prevalences of short stature (height for age below the 10th percentile) decreased from 40.9{\%} to 12.0{\%} in prepubertal males, from 44.2{\%} to 20.4{\%} in pubertal males, from 29.8{\%} to 12.7{\%} in prepubertal females, and from 41.1{\%} to 25.8{\%} in pubertal females.Conclusions Chile represents a special model of fast changes in nutritional and growth trends due to social and political interventions and economic development. The significance of these findings in the health of Chilean adults and the urgency to implement measures to prevent further increases in obesity and simultaneously decrease the prevalence of short stature are discussed.},

abstract = {This chapter introduces the reader to comparative historical analysis (CHA), one of the oldest methods in the social science repertoire. CHA is characterized by its emphasis on historically contextualized comparisons explicitly aimed at producing causal arguments about the macro-sociological phenomena. After a theoretical overview that discusses the method's nature, logic, and central concepts, the chapter turns its attention to practical matters. Thus, rather than an extended scientific discussion of what CHA is, the chapter seeks to encourage interested students by providing them with a series of tools and techniques that can be used when doing comparative historical research on social movements and revolutions. More specifically, the chapter offers a five-step approach: research design and puzzle formulation; data identification; the use of data; data analysis; and the writing process. A discussion on the use of technology in the research process is present throughout the practical part of the chapter.},

abstract = {So the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they ceased building the city. – Genesis 11:8 In this book, in order to study the influence of context, I have moved across space and time. One way to experience a change in context on a tremendous scale, across both space and time, is to travel south across the United States toward the Mexican border. Start at a city in the Midwest, say Chicago, and as you travel south, with each mile toward the border, the Anglo proportion of the population will decline and the culture and people will become more Latino. 1 Figuratively, you will be moving through time as the cities become not only less Anglo but also generally less dense, with the older, more compact cities of the Northeast and Midwest giving way to the newer, sprawling, car-based cities of the Southwest. In a Midwestern city like Chicago, where so much social science – including parts of this book – has been focused, you are in the urban past. When you reach a city like Phoenix – low-density and only 120 miles from the Mexican border – you are in the urban future. Chicago and other big cities of the Northeast and Midwest represent not only the urban past but also, with their large Anglo white and African American populations, the demographic past. The populations of these cities were a result of the previous great migration – northward and westward – of African Americans from the South. Now, different currents are flowing: Anglos are moving south and west and Latinos are coming north. The demographic future of the United States is found in the meeting of Anglos and Latinos in these sprawling, fast-growing communities near the Mexican border. 2},

abstract = {In a recent contribution to this journal, Munck and Snyder found that many studies suffer from a deficient application of qualitative and quantitative methods. They argue that the combination of small-n and large-n analysis represents a viable method for promoting the production of knowledge. Recently, Evan Lieberman proposed nested analysis as a rigorous approach for comparative research that builds on the complementary strengths of quantitative and qualitative analysis. In this paper, the author examines the methodological potential of nested inference to advance comparative political analysis, arguing that the specific methodological problems of nested designs have not been fully appreciated. It is shown that, under certain circumstances, nothing is gained from a nested analysis. On the contrary, one might lose more than one gains compared to single-method designs. The author suggests specific methodological principles that take these problems into account to make nested analysis fruitful for comparative studies.},

The conventional explanation is that legislation put an end to agent-mediated distribution. But this explanation leaves many questions unanswered. Why did the parties use agents for decades, even though they imposed great expense on candidates and were viewed as untrustworthy? And why, after decades of half-hearted reforms, did the House of Commons pass effective anti-bribery reforms only in 1883? In our formal model, parties hire agents to solve information problems, but agent-mediated distribution can be collectively sub-optimal. Legislation can serve as a credibility device for shifting to less costly strategies.},

abstract = {In much of the developing world, a model of polycentric governance has become increasingly prevalent for the control of health and infectious disease - one in which a panoply of governance actors work concurrently on the same development projects, within the same localities. And yet, the question of whether polycentrism helps or hinders disease control/mitigation, or service provision more generally, has not been sufficiently studied. This article details findings from an exploratory case study of the polycentric governance of infectious disease in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Combining analyses of an original survey of local councilors, structured interviews with relevant actors in four municipalities, and a national survey of South African citizens, the study finds a high degree of polycentric governance, and highlights associated accountability gaps and a series of constraints on effective service delivery. It concludes by identifying promising directions for future research. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper combines dynamic social choice and strategic experimentation to study the following question: How does a society, a committee, or, more generally, a group of individuals with potentially heterogeneous preferences, experiment with new opportunities? Each voter recognizes that, during experimentation, other voters also learn about their preferences. As a result, pivotal voters today are biased against experimentation because it reduces their likelihood of remaining pivotal. This phenomenon reduces equilibrium experimentation below the socially efficient level, and may even result in a negative option value of experimentation. However, one can restore efficiency by designing a voting rule that depends deterministically on time. Another main result is that even when payoffs of a reform are independently distributed across the population, good news about any individual's payoff increases other individuals' incentives to experiment with that reform, due to a positive voting externality.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new model of household choice of neighborhood and housing consumption, and uses it to predict the effects of alternative housing voucher policies on the choices of voucher recipients and their levels of wellbeing. The model is estimated using household level data from housing voucher recipients in Pittsburgh, aggregate data on unsubsidized households, and a large dataset of neighborhood characteristics including crime rates, school quality, racial composition, and housing prices. Using the estimated model, this study predicts effects of a variety of interesting reforms of the housing voucher program, namely, a more generous voucher subsidy, subsidy amounts that vary with census tract housing prices instead of metropolitan area prices, subsidies that are proportional to the market rent of the specific units, and a requirement that voucher recipients live in a census tract where the poverty rate is less than 30{\%} .},

Another purpose is to integrate classic ideas proposed by consumer researchers with emerging concepts and models proposed by cognitive psychologists, social psychologists, and other social scientists. Finally, the authors' aim is to present several new ideas on goal setting and goal striving and point out how they can enrich the study and practice of consumer behavior.},

He also offers an extensive review of the concept and rationale of the political party, and develops a sharp critique of various spatial models of party competition. This is political science at its best - combining the intelligent use of theory with sophisticated analytic arguments, and grounding all of this on a substantial cross-national empirical base. Parties and Party Systems is one of the classics of postwar political science, and is now established as the foremost work in its field.

abstract = {Korean parents have high demands for their children's education. Korean households' expenditure pattern for private tutoring has been revealed through various surveys, but their demand for public school education has been rarely analyzed. Using the Housing Market Survey on the Seoul metropolitan area in 2001, this study estimates the household-level demand function for public school quality by applying a rigorous economic analysis model (Rosen's two-step estimation scheme). In the first step, this study estimated the impact of public school quality on house prices using the hedonic price function. This estimate can then be used as the implicit price for public school quality. Based on this, the study next estimated the household-level demand function for public school quality. Results showed that public school quality, as measured by the number of students per 1,000 graduates who entered Seoul National University, has a significant impact on house prices in the Seoul metropolitan area. The demand function estimation showed that the implicit price of school quality, household income and household head's educational attainment are the significant factors that determine parental demand for good schools. In particular, a 10{\%} increase in household income level results in attendance at a school that has 0.235 more students accepted by Seoul National University per 1,000 graduates, all other factors remaining constant.},

In order to explain the rise of lower-caste politics, I examine the ways in which relationships between state institutions, caste networks and locally dominant groups shape contemporary political possibilities, necessitating a re-evaluation of the relationship between liberalism and democracy in India. With state institutions being unable to effectively enforce rights, a caste-based notion of popular sovereignty became dominant - as an idea (the lower-caste majority should rule) and as the everyday rough-and-tumble of an electoral politics that ultimately revolves around the force of numbers. It is inadequate, and actually unhelpful, to simply point out the obvious fact that the enforcement of rights is routinely and systematically undermined in practice and to call for more effective implementation. In fact, I argue that effective implementation in places such as Bihar could only be possible through a radical restructuring of local power that can only come from below, through democratic practice itself.},

abstract = {During the 1990s, the Argentine federal government dramatically increased the number of workfare programs targeted to the unemployed. The distribution of employment programs, however, varied across provinces. Previous studies suggest that this uneven distribution has taken place because politicians have not distributed programs according to formal eligibility criteria, but rather, in a clientelistic manner to entice voters' support. I conduct a balanced pooled time series analysis for twenty-four provinces for the period 1993-2002 and find that partisanship, institutional features of the Argentine federal system, social mobilization, and economic factors strongly determine the way in which presidents have distributed employment programs. The results challenge the assumption that these programs have been exclusively used as clientelistic handouts to buy people's votes, and point to the necessity of looking at institutional, social, and economic variables to better understand the criteria used by federal politicians to distribute means-tested programs. /// Durante los a{\~{n}}os noventa, el gobierno nacional argentino ha incrementado en forma dram{\'{a}}tica el n{\'{u}}mero de programas destinado a la poblaci{\'{o}}n desempleada. Sin embargo, la distribuci{\'{o}}n de estos programas ha variado de provincia en provincia. Diversos estudios se{\~{n}}alan que esta distribuci{\'{o}}n desigual ha sido posible debido a que los funcionarios no han distribuido los programas de acuerdo a criterios formales de idoneidad, sino m{\'{a}}s bien, de forma clientelar para obtener el respaldo de los votantes. Utilizando una serie temporal para 24 provincias durante el per{\'{i}}odo 1993-2002, este art{\'{i}}culo demuestra que el color partidario, los aspectos institucionales del federalismo argentino, la movilizaci{\'{o}}n social, y ciertos factores econ{\'{o}}micos han determinado la forma en que los presidentes han distribuido dichos programas de empleo. Los resultados que se presentan cuestionan el presupuesto seg{\'{u}}n el cual estos programas se han utilizado exclusivamente como moneda de cambio para comprar votos, y se{\~{n}}alan la importancia de incorporar variables institucionales, sociales y ec{\'{o}}nomicas para entender de forma m{\'{a}}s acabada el criterio con el cual los funcionarios nacionales distribuyen programas focalizados.},

Historically, waterborne transport of goods required portage around the falls at these points, while some falls provided water power during early industrialization. These factors attracted commerce and manufacturing. Although these original advantages have long since been made obsolete, the authors document the continuing-and even increasing-importance of these portage sites over time. They interpret this finding in a model with path dependence arising from local increasing returns to scale.},

abstract = {We provide evidence on the effect of market illegality on violence. Brazil was historically the main exporter of mahogany. Starting in the 1990s, trade was restricted and eventually prohibited. We build on previous evidence that mahogany trade persisted after prohibition and document relative increases in violence in areas with natural occurrence of mahogany. We show that as illegal activity receded in the late 2000s so did the relative increase in violence. We describe an experience of increase in violence following the transition of a market from legal to illegal and contribute to the evaluation of prohibition policies under limited enforcement.

abstract = {Does radio access improve public service provision? And if so, does it do so by increasing government accountability to citizens, or by persuading households to take advantage of publicly-provided services? Prior research has argued that citizens with greater access to mass media receive greater benefits from targeted government welfare programs, but has not addressed these questions for public services such as in education and health. Using unique data from Benin, this paper finds that literacy rates among school children are higher in villages exposed to signals from a larger number of community radio stations. The effect is identified based on a “natural experiment” in the northern communes of Benin where within-commune variation in village access to radio stations is exogenous to observed and unobserved village characteristics. In contrast to prior research, the authors find that this media effect does not operate through government accountability: government inputs into village schools and household knowledge of government education policies are no different in villages with greater access to community radio. Instead, households with greater access are more likely to make financial investments in the education of their children.},

abstract = {Este trabalho procura fornecer elementos para o entendimento das recentes mudan{\c{c}}as verificadas no cen{\'{a}}rio eleitoral dos estados mais pobres e de menor competitividade eleitoral do pa{\'{i}}s. O trabalho tem como objetivo identificar os fatores por tr{\'{a}}s da s{\'{e}}rie de vit{\'{o}}rias obtidas por coaliz{\~{o}}es de centro-esquerda nas elei{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es estaduais de 2002 e 2006, em paralelo ao enfraquecimento dos antigos chefes pol{\'{i}}ticos. Duas hip{\'{o}}teses s{\~{a}}o elaboradas para dar conta dessas transforma{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es. Primeiro, argumenta-se que, no federalismo multipartid{\'{a}}rio constru{\'{i}}do no Brasil, a competi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o vertical entre os governos federal e estadual na oferta de pol{\'{i}}ticas sociais atua no sentido de constranger as estrat{\'{e}}gias de distribui{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de patronagem e controle da arena eleitoral dos chefes pol{\'{i}}ticos estaduais. Em segundo lugar, o artigo argumenta que o sistema eleitoral brasileiro tende a promover a fragmenta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o pol{\'{i}}tica e a aumentar os custos de forma{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de coaliz{\~{o}}es vencedoras, ao mesmo tempo em que a aus{\^{e}}ncia de partidos pol{\'{i}}ticos fortes dificulta a estabiliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da competi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o inter-elite e das redes de patronagem controladas pelos governos estaduais. A an{\'{a}}lise emp{\'{i}}rica ap{\'{o}}ia-se em t{\'{e}}cnicas de an{\'{a}}lise de regress{\~{a}}o linear e correla{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o linear simples, de modo a explorar a conex{\~{a}}o entre a pol{\'{i}}tica nacional e estadual ao longo dos anos 1990 e 2000. Por fim, o artigo analisa em detalhe o decl{\'{i}}nio da m{\'{a}}quina pol{\'{i}}tica do Partido da Frente Liberal (PFL) na Bahia, que havia dominado a pol{\'{i}}tica estadual por d{\'{e}}cadas, no contexto da vit{\'{o}}ria do Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT) nas elei{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es para Governador em 2006. Essa se{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o desenvolve um modelo de regress{\~{a}}o linear para testar o impacto da din{\^{a}}mica pol{\'{i}}tica local e dos gastos federais de combate {\`{a}} pobreza (Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia) sobre o desempenho eleitoral do PT em 2006. O trabalho conclui que as institui{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es democr{\'{a}}ticas brasileiras conspiram contra a sobreviv{\^{e}}ncia da chefia pol{\'{i}}tica no n{\'{i}}vel estadual, o que indica a necessidade de reavaliar as vis{\~{o}}es j{\'{a}} estabelecidas sobre a pol{\'{i}}tica estadual.},

@unpublished{Alston2006,
abstract = {This paper uses a transaction-costs framework to link the policymaking process (PMP) and the outer features of public policies in Mexico, a middle-income developing country. It shows how a highly secretive PMP, centralized around the presidency, fashioned nationalist policies that were stable, adaptable, coordinated and private-regarding for the urban-based corporatist pillars of the regime. When growth faltered in the late 1970s, however, this PMP was unable to adapt to economic volatility, although it remained dominant in an increasingly turbulent polity. The paper explains how unified government and corporatist control of the economy made a constitutionally weak president the envy of executives around the world, even at the cost of being unable to enact reforms with short-term costs for the corporatist pillars of the regime. The article also explains why democratization in the 1990s is giving rise to a less centralized and more open PMP that benefits larger shares of the population. As the separation of powers enshrined in the 1917 constitution materializes, policymaking is increasingly wedded to the status quo. On the one hand, divided government preserves a macroeconomic framework consistent with an open economy (such as fiscally sound policies and a floating exchange rate). On the other, checks and balances are helping old and new parties and interest groups to veto agreement on the raising of chronically low tax rates (at 10 percent of GDP) and on reforming nationalist policies that limit private sector investment in the state-controlled energy sector.},

abstract = {Previous analyses of African politics have mistaken parties' dearth of position taking on issues as an absence of substantive electoral debate. The authors demonstrate that political parties tackle substantive issues during African elections, but generally voice them through valence appeals rather than by staking out distinct positions. The authors theorize that uncertainty, coupled with the single-party heritage and the elite dominance of African electoral politics, leads parties to employ valence discourse in their national election campaigns. With evidence from 950 newspaper articles during seven election cycles in African countries, the authors show that politicians predominantly use valence discourse when discussing political issues in the period approaching elections. They find tentative evidence that opposition actors are more likely to take positions than incumbents, and that civil society is more likely to raise position issues than political parties. This contribution aims to enrich the debate on electoral issues in Africa, but also draw greater attention to the potential impact of valence discourse on party systems in a comparative context.},

The theory is grounded in the causal inference and HLM modeling literature, and the empirical work focuses on commonly-used designs in education research to test intervention effects on student test scores. The main conclusion is that three to four times larger samples are typically required under RD than experimental clustered designs to produce impacts with the same level of statistical precision. Thus, the viability of using RD designs for new impact evaluations of educational interventions may be limited, and will depend on the point of treatment assignment, the availability of pretests, and key research questions.},

We create an analytical model that is capable of generating both transitory and sustained episodes of accelerated growth. The new feature is a feedback loop from existing economic conditions the pressures on policy implementing ‘institutions.' This feedback loop can be positive (with economic growth leading to improved institutions for inclusive growth) or negative (with economic growth leading to worse conditions for further growth by shutting off the inclusiveness of growth and limiting economic opportunity to existing successes). Whether economic elites use their influence activities with political and bureaucratic elites to create more possibilities for economic structural transformation or, conversely, use their power to entrench their privileged position will, to a significant extent, determine whether episodes of rapid growth can be sustained or will peter out, or even be reversed. The mechanisms for elite commitment to sustained inclusive growth are discussed.},

abstract = {Using a measure of tunneling out of Russian firms, constructed from banking transactions data as transfers of cash out of legitimate to fly-by-night firms, we show that firms that get public procurement contracts exhibit abnormally high tunneling rates within four weeks of regional elections. In contrast, firms with no public procurement revenue exhibit no tunneling around election cycles. Since politicians on the campaign trail need cash the most around election time, they are the most likely recipients of tunneled cash close to elections. Using variation in the quality of tax inspectors as a source of exogenous variation in tunneling, we document a causal relationship from tunneling around elections to obtaining public procurement contracts. Two placebo experiments -- using placebo election dates and legitimate rather than shadow transfers -- confirm the validity of our empirical strategy. Our estimates yield a locality-level measure of corruption in public procurement. Using this measure, we reject the "efficient greasing" hypothesis by showing that, in more corrupt localities, public procurement contracts are allocated to less efficient firms, and therefore, corruption has negative welfare implications.},

abstract = {lientelism is common in developing countries, and often detrimentally affects political accountability and public good provision. However, little is known about how clientelistic equilibria break down, particularly because reforms that could reduce voter dependence on incumbents for special favors may also cause vot- ers to reward the reform's architects. Exploiting Mexico's federal structure and changes in incumbency over time, we separate these countervailing effects in the context of a federal land titling program that reached nearly 2.16 million urban households over 35 years. We find that municipal incumbents, who were not responsible for the program's implementation but often rely on weak property rights to enforce clientelistic exchanges, experience a large and persistent decrease in their vote share in electoral precincts where the program was implemented. The clientelistic capacity of future federal incumbents is diminished to a lesser degree. However, we show that this loss is more than compensated for by the lasting increase in the implementing federal incumbent's vote share among the land titling program's beneficiaries. Aligned municipal incumbents also success- fully claim credit, receiving a smaller boost that partially offsets their loss of clientelistic capacity. These results thus demonstrate that major programmatic reforms can both reduce clientelism while also rewarding incumbents for their policies in office. ∗We},

The paper starts with a consideration of the ways in which the terms ?democracy? and ?citizenship? have been used in the discourses and approaches taken within mainstream studies of citizenship and democracy, drawing attention to some of the conceptual blind spots that arise. We call for more attention to be paid to contextual understandings of the politics of everyday life, and to locating state, ngo and donor rhetorics and programmes promoting ?active citizenship? and ?participatory governance? within that politics. It is this kind of understanding, we suggest, that, by revealing the limits of the normativities embedded in these discourses, can provide a more substantive basis for rethinking citizenship from the perspectives of citizens themselves.

abstract = {Democracies, and the citizenries that stand at their center, are not natural phenomena; they are made and sustained through politics. Government policies can play a crucial role in this process, shaping the things publics believe and want, the ways citizens view themselves and others, and how they understand and act toward the political system. Yet, while political scientists have said a great deal about how publics influence policies, they know far less about the ways policies influence publics. In this article, we seek to clarify how policies, once enacted, are likely to affect political thought and action in the citizenry. Such effects are hard to locate within the standard framework of approaches to mass behavior, and they are generally ignored by program evaluators and policy analysts. To bridge this gap, we direct attention toward a long and vibrant, but underappreciated, line of inquiry we call the “political tradition” of mass behavior research. Drawing this tradition together with recent work on “policy feedback,” we outline a framework for thinking about how policies influence mass politics. The major types of such effects include defining membership; forging political cohesion and group divisions; building or undermining civic capacities; framing policy agendas, problems, and evaluations; and structuring, stimulating, and stalling political participation.},

abstract = {A vast literature suggests that voters in new democracies ‘sell' their vote to patrons providing private or small-scale club goods, or, alternatively, that such goods are distributed along ethnic lines to reinforce ethnic voting. In either case the outcome is undermining democratic accountability. This study finds that citizens in one new democracy – Ghana – expect (and get) the patronage but at the same time engage in economic voting. Eighty-five percent of citizens first and foremost expect their legislators to supply private or small-scale ‘club' goods. This acts as a strong incentive for politicians to actually supply such goods, which is confirmed by participants' observational data and more than 250 interviews conducted by the author. Despite this, citizens do not vote based on how well or how poorly incumbent MPs provide clientelistic goods. A multivariate analysis reveals that voting for the opposition or the incumbent is determined by evaluations of the state of the national economy and of the government's policies. What the literature has portrayed as an ‘either-or' is ‘both', and this is perfectly rational: Extract as much as one can in terms of private and small club goods but vote based on economic factors. The literature suggests that clientelism dominates elections in newer democracies and thus undermines democracy. The findings from this study suggest that while distribution of clientelistic goods is common, this does not necessarily undermine the mechanism of democratic accountability in elections.},

abstract = {Poverty remains one of the most pressing problems facing the world; the mechanisms through which poverty arises and perpetuates itself, however, are not well understood. Here, we examine the evidence for the hypothesis that poverty may have particular psychological consequences that can lead to economic behaviors that make it difficult to escape poverty. The evidence indicates that poverty causes stress and negative affective states which in turn may lead to short-sighted and risk-averse decision-making, possibly by limiting attention and favoring habitual behaviors at the expense of goal-directed ones. Together, these relationships may constitute a feedback loop that contributes to the perpetuation of poverty. We conclude by pointing toward specific gaps in our knowledge and outlining poverty alleviation programs that this mechanism suggests.},

abstract = {Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a way of exploring spatial nonstationarity by calibrating a multiple regression model which allows different relationships to exist at different points in space. Nevertheless, formal testing procedures for spatial nonstationarity have not been developed since the inception of the model. In this paper the authors focus mainly on the development of statistical testing methods relating to this model. Some appropriate statistics for testing the goodness of fit of the GWR model and for testing variation of the parameters in the model are proposed and their approximated distributions are investigated. The work makes it possible to test spatial nonstationarity in a conventional statistical manner. To substantiate the theoretical arguments, some simulations are run to examine the power of the statistics for exploring spatial nonstationarity and the results are encouraging. To streamline the model, a stepwise procedure for choosing important independent variables is also formulated. In the last section, a prediction problem based on the GWR model is studied, and a confidence interval for the true value of the dependent variable at a new location is also established. The study paves the path for formal analysis of spatial nonstationarity on the basis of the GWR model.},

abstract = {Bangladesh is dominated by a small-holder agrarian economy under extreme stress. Production shortfalls, increasing economic polarization, and chronic malnutrition are persistent, but major famine has been diverted in part by significant growth in agriculture. This recent history is open to both Malthusian and Boserupian interpretations-a history we explore here through a test of the induced intensification thesis of agricultural change. This thesis, framed by variations in the behavior of small-holders, has grown from a simple demand-production relationship to a consideration of the mediating influences on that relationship. The induced intensification thesis is reviewed and tested for 265 households in 6 villages in Bangladesh from 1950-1986. A time-series analysis of an induced intensification model provides relatively high levels of explained variance in cropping intensity (frequency and land productivity) and also indicates the relative impacts of household class, environment, and cropping strategies. On average, the small-holders in question kept pace with the demands on production, although important class and village variations were evident and the proportion of landless households increased. These results, coupled with evidence that agricultural growth involved intensification thresholds, provide clues about Malthusian and Boserupian interpretations of Bangladesh, and suggest that small-holder agriculture there is likely to continue on a "muted" path of growth.},

We explore the institutional underpinnings of service provision, digging down beneath the "rules of the game" to analyze the beliefs, understandings, and dispositions that drive social behavior. Changes in deep social attitudes led to improvements in social indicators. Regional variation in health outcomes is explained by the presence or absence of a dense web of relationships that enmeshed reformers in local systems of authority and legitimacy, strengthening their actions and making local society more susceptible to change. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {I study how a revolutionary vanguard might use violence to mobilize a mass public. The mechanism is informational—the vanguard uses violence to manipulate population member's beliefs about the level of antigovernment sentiment in society. The model has multiple equilibria, one equilibrium in which there may be revolution and another in which there is certain not to be. In the former, structural factors influence expected mobilization, whereas in the latter they do not. Hence, the model is consistent with structural factors influencing the likelihood of revolution in some societies but not others, offering a partial defense of structural accounts from common critiques. The model also challenges standard arguments about the role of revolutionary vanguards. The model is consistent with vanguard violence facilitating mobilization and even sparking spontaneous uprisings. However, it also predicts selection effects—an active vanguard emerges only in societies that are already coordinated on a participatory equilibrium. Hence, a correlation between vanguard activity and mass mobilization may not constitute evidence for the causal efficacy of vanguards—be it through creating focal points, providing selective incentives, or communicating information.},

abstract = {This article evaluates the impact of industrialization and urbanization on residential segregation by income among Brazilian metropolitan areas. Using data from the 1980 census of Brazil, the author finds that more-industrialized areas have lower segregation because they have lower income inequality. However, urbanization, particularly population size, explains most of the variation in segregation among metropolitan areas. The conclusion is that the extent of urbanization, which is dependent of industrialization, is key to understanding socioeconomic spatial inequalities in the large and rapidly growing cities of less-developed countries, but that conclusions regarding the effects of industrialization throught industrial location or investment in real estate have been overgeneralized.},

A review of the most recent wave of research on political clientelism traces some of its major paradigmatic and conceptual trends and shifts, addresses its institutional viability under democracy and market economy, and delineates the future direction of research on the institutional contexts favoring or constraining it.},

abstract = {Bangladesh is dominated by a small-holder agrarian economy under extreme stress. Production shortfalls, increasing economic polarization, and chronic malnutrition are persistent, but major famine has been diverted in part by significant growth in agriculture. This recent history is open to both Malthusian and Boserupian interpretations-a history we explore here through a test of the induced intensification thesis of agricultural change. This thesis, framed by variations in the behavior of small-holders, has grown from a simple demand-production relationship to a consideration of the mediating influences on that relationship. The induced intensification thesis is reviewed and tested for 265 households in 6 villages in Bangladesh from 1950-1986. A time-series analysis of an induced intensification model provides relatively high levels of explained variance in cropping intensity (frequency and land productivity) and also indicates the relative impacts of household class, environment, and cropping strategies. On average, the small-holders in question kept pace with the demands on production, although important class and village variations were evident and the proportion of landless households increased. These results, coupled with evidence that agricultural growth involved intensification thresholds, provide clues about Malthusian and Boserupian interpretations of Bangladesh, and suggest that small-holder agriculture there is likely to continue on a "muted" path of growth.},

abstract = {Existing evidence suggests that extra grant revenues lead to little improvements in public services in developing countries - but would governments spend tax revenues differently? This paper considers a program that invests in the tax capacity of Brazilian municipalities. Using variations in the timing of program uptake I find that it raises local tax revenues and that the increase in taxes is used to improve both the quantity and quality of municipal education infrastructure. In contrast increases in grants over which municipalities have the same discretion as over taxes have no impact on any measure of local public infrastructure.},

However, this intergenerational picture changes if public education is also considered as a transfer program. We calculate the net present value (NPV) of benefits received minus taxes paid for US generations born 1850 to 2090. Surprisingly, all generations 1950 to 2050 are net gainers, while many current elderly are losers. Windfall gains from starting Social Security and Medicare partially offset windfall losses from starting public education, roughly consistent with the Becker-Murphy theory.},

@article{Subramanian2004,
abstract = {Objectives: To examine the prevalence and incidence, clinical presentation, societal impact and comorbid conditions of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in the general population. Methods: Cross-sectional, nationally representative neurotological survey of the general adult population in Germany with a two stage sampling design: screening of 4869 participants from the German National Telephone Health Interview Survey 2003 (response rate 52{\%}) for moderate or severe dizziness or vertigo, followed by validated neurotological interviews (n = 1003; response rate 87{\%}). Diagnostic criteria for BPPV were at least five attacks of vestibular vertigo lasting {\textless}1 min without concomitant neurological symptoms and invariably provoked by typical changes in head position. In a concurrent validation study (n = 61) conducted in two specialised dizziness clinics, BPPV was detected by our telephone interview with a specificity of 92{\%} and a sensitivity of 88{\%} (positive predictive value 88{\%}, negative predictive value 92{\%}). Results: BPPV accounted for 8{\%} of individuals with moderate or severe dizziness/vertigo. The lifetime prevalence of BPPV was 2.4{\%}, the 1 year prevalence was 1.6{\%} and the 1 year incidence was 0.6{\%}. The median duration of an episode was 2 weeks. In 86{\%} of affected individuals, BPPV led to medical consultation, interruption of daily activities or sick leave. In total, only 8{\%} of affected participants received effective treatment. On multivariate analysis, age, migraine, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and stroke were independently associated with BPPV. Conclusion: BPPV is a common vestibular disorder leading to significant morbidity, psychosocial impact and medical costs},

abstract = {This paper combines dynamic social choice and strategic experimentation to study the following question: How does a society, a committee, or, more generally, a group of individuals with potentially heterogeneous preferences, experiment with new opportunities? Each voter recognizes that, during experimentation, other voters also learn about their preferences. As a result, pivotal voters today are biased against experimentation because it reduces their likelihood of remaining pivotal. This phenomenon reduces equilibrium experimentation below the socially efficient level, and may even result in a negative option value of experimentation. However, one can restore efficiency by designing a voting rule that depends deterministically on time. Another main result is that even when payoffs of a reform are independently distributed across the population, good news about any individual's payoff increases other individuals' incentives to experiment with that reform, due to a positive voting externality.},

One purpose of this article is to outline a conceptual framework for thinking about how goals emerge, influence decision making, and guide consumer choice and action. Another purpose is to integrate classic ideas proposed by consumer researchers with emerging concepts and models proposed by cognitive psychologists, social psychologists, and other social scientists. Finally, the authors' aim is to present several new ideas on goal setting and goal striving and point out how they can enrich the study and practice of consumer behavior.},

This paper studies the targeting of a healthcare-centre programme aimed at the poor that relies on household self-selection into the programme at the local level. We find that a key variable in determining utilisation of the health centres is location. Households living near a centre are substantially more likely to use it than households living further away. This points to the importance of facility placement in targeting self-selected health programmes to the poor. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {This article explores the recon guration of social citizenship, or ‘market citizenship', underway in Chile, as one crucial dimension of the refashioning of state institutions along neo-liberal lines in Latin America. It focuses on the ‘civilizing' dimension of social citizenship, as an instance of the state's involve- ment in the regulation of subordinate populations. Speci cally, the article studies the case of new social policy aimed at poverty alleviation. Inspired by Michel Foucault's late work but moving beyond it, it examines institutional transformation as on-the-ground practices through which policies take effect and sees ‘market citizenship ' as emerging from the rearticulation of the efforts of myriad individuals located at different levels of government, ‘civil society', and poor and working-class communities. In this process, state agents are trans- lators on the one hand of of cial documents into instances of participatory learning and empowerment, and on the other of people's realities into instances of documentary categories of poverty. This cultural–political transformation of neo-liberal modernization in Chile and beyond is potentially radical, and we need to ask: to what extent will the new market terms of belonging in the national community, which increasingly permeate private and public actions and discourse, change the very material and cultural contexts in which people's lives and struggles are framed?},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Aim of this study was to compare the results of the surgical repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears with and without resection of the lateral clavicle. METHODS: 102 patients were retrospectively observed by an independent observer for a mean follow-up of 21 months (12 - 42). 93 patients had medium to large sized tears (1 - 5 cm) and 9 had massive tears ({\textgreater}5 cm). Additional resection of the lateral end of the clavicle was performed in 20 patients. The mean age of the 68 men and 34 woman was 57.3 years (28 - 80). For the evaluation the Constant score, the ASES score and the visual analogue scales for postoperative satisfaction, function, strength, pain and ADL were used. RESULTS: The subjective results were good to excellent in 79 patients (76 {\%}), fair in 14 patients (13.7 {\%}) and poor in 9 patients (8.9 {\%}), too. After surgery the Constant score was 87 {\%} of the contralateral side for all patients, 89 {\%} for group I and 84 {\%} for group II and the mean ASES score was 86 {\%}, 87 {\%} and 82 {\%} of the contralateral side. Comparing the pre- and post-operative values on the visual analogue scale pain and disability in ADL were decreased highly significantly in all patients (p {\textless}0.001). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: We conclude that in patients with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear the patient's satisfaction and function will improve after acromioplasty and rotator cuff repair. The results are not significantly influenced by an additional resection of the lateral clavicle.},

abstract = {With an unrepresentative sample, the estimate of a causal effect may fail to characterize how effects operate in the population of interest. What is less well understood is that conventional estimation practices for observational studies may produce the same problem even with a representative sample. Causal effects estimated via multiple regression differentially weight each unit's contribution. The “effective sample” that regression uses to generate the estimate may bear little resemblance to the population of interest, and the results may be nonrepresentative in a manner similar to what quasi-experimental methods or experiments with convenience samples produce. There is no general external validity basis for preferring multiple regression on representative samples over quasi-experimental or experimental methods. We show how to estimate the “multiple regression weights” that allow one to study the effective sample. We discuss alternative approaches that, under certain conditions, recover representative average causal effects. The requisite conditions cannot always be met.},

abstract = {I develop a model of cooperation in small irrigation systems. I give conditions under which an equalizing redistribution of wealth increases the level of equilibrium cooperation, but also show that some redistributions that increase inequality can also increase cooperation. The distributive rule, a combination of arrangements for maintenance-cost sharing and water allocation, also affects the cooperation level. I estimate statistical models of cooperation for three maintenance indicators using field data from a study of Mexican irrigation societies. Social heterogeneity and landholding inequality are significantly associated with lower maintenance. Distributive rules that allocate water proportionally to landholding size likewise reduce maintenance.},

Amelia II implements our bootstrapping-based algorithm that gives essentially the same answers as the standard IP or EMis approaches, is usually considerably faster than existing approaches and can handle many more variables. Unlike Amelia I and other statistically rigorous imputation software, it virtually never crashes (but please let us know if you find to the contrary!). The program also generalizes existing approaches by allowing for trends in time series across observations within a cross-sectional unit, as well as priors that allow experts to incorporate beliefs they have about the values of missing cells in their data. Amelia II also includes useful diagnostics of the fit of multiple imputation models. The program works from the R command line or via a graphical user interface that does not require users to know R.},

abstract = {The expansion and politicization of the postcommunist state, even among the reform leaders of Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, has confounded early expectations that the state would shrink and grow autonomous once the communist regime collapsed. The variation in these patterns is a function of the distribution of party power in parliament, both over time (turnover) and among parties (fragmentation and effective opposition). Where several strong opposing parties competed for governance, the resulting electoral uncertainty led them to constrain each other through formal regulations and informal practices. In contrast, where one party dominated political competition, lax (or nonexistent) regulations allowed the informal extraction of resources from state firms, the procurement of favorable privatization deals, and the accumulation of positions in public administration. This explanation contrasts with existing accounts, which emphasize either broad communist regime legacies or the functional need for state growth in newly independent states.},

@article{Farrell2007,
abstract = {Switching costs and network effects bind customers to vendors if products are incompatible, locking customers or even markets in to early choices. Lock-in hinders customers from changing suppliers in response to (predictable or unpredictable) changes in efficiency, and gives vendors lucrative ex post market power - over the same buyer in the case of switching costs (or brand loyalty), or over others with network effects. Firms compete ex ante for this ex post power, using penetration pricing, introductory offers, and price wars. Such "competition for the market" or "life-cycle competition" can adequately replace ordinary compatible competition, and can even be fiercer than compatible competition by weakening differentiation. More often, however, incompatible competition not only involves direct efficiency losses but also softens competition and magnifies incumbency advantages. With network effects, established firms have little incentive to offer better deals when buyers' and complementors' expectations hinge on non-efficiency factors (especially history such as past market shares), and although competition between incompatible networks is initially unstable and sensitive to competitive offers and random events, it later "tips" to monopoly, after which entry is hard, often even too hard given incompatibility. And while switching costs can encourage small-scale entry, they discourage sellers from raiding one another's existing customers, and so also discourage more aggressive entry. Because of these competitive effects, even inefficient incompatible competition is often more profitable than compatible competition, especially for dominant firms with installed-base or expectational advantages. Thus firms probably seek incompatibility too often. We therefore favor thoughtfully pro-compatibility public policy. {\textcopyright}2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper shows that the gender of politicians affects the educational levels of individuals who grow up in the districts where these politicians are elected. A unique dataset collected on politicians in India is matched with individual data by cohort and district of residence. The political data allow the identification of close elections between women and men, which yield quasi-experimental election outcomes used to estimate the causal effect of the gender of politicians. Increasing female political representation increases the probability that an individual will attain primary education in urban areas, but not in rural areas, and not in the sample as a whole.

abstract = {This paper uses a transaction-costs framework to link the policymaking process (PMP) and the outer features of public policies in Mexico, a middle-income developing country. It shows how a highly secretive PMP, centralized around the presidency, fashioned nationalist policies that were stable, adaptable, coordinated and private-regarding for the urban-based corporatist pillars of the regime. When growth faltered in the late 1970s, however, this PMP was unable to adapt to economic volatility, although it remained dominant in an increasingly turbulent polity. The paper explains how unified government and corporatist control of the economy made a constitutionally weak president the envy of executives around the world, even at the cost of being unable to enact reforms with short-term costs for the corporatist pillars of the regime. The article also explains why democratization in the 1990s is giving rise to a less centralized and more open PMP that benefits larger shares of the population. As the separation of powers enshrined in the 1917 constitution materializes, policymaking is increasingly wedded to the status quo. On the one hand, divided government preserves a macroeconomic framework consistent with an open economy (such as fiscally sound policies and a floating exchange rate). On the other, checks and balances are helping old and new parties and interest groups to veto agreement on the raising of chronically low tax rates (at 10 percent of GDP) and on reforming nationalist policies that limit private sector investment in the state-controlled energy sector.},

abstract = {Across a wide set of non-group insurance markets, applicants are rejected based on observable, often high-risk, characteristics. This paper argues that private information, held by the potential applicant pool, explains rejections. I formulate this argument by developing and testing a model in which agents may have private information about their risk. I first derive a new no-trade result that theoretically explains how private information could cause rejections. I then develop a new empirical methodology to test whether this no-trade condition can explain rejections. The methodology uses subjective probability elicitations as noisy measures of agents beliefs. I apply this approach to three non-group markets: long-term care, disability, and life insurance. Consistent with the predictions of the theory, in all three settings I find significant amounts of private information held by those who would be rejected; I find generally more private information for those who would be rejected relative to those who can purchase insurance; and I show it is enough private information to explain a complete absence of trade for those who would be rejected. The results suggest private information prevents the existence of large segments of these three major insurance markets.},

In developed countries, this phenomenon of urban sprawl has a significant attention with regard to how it is described as well as its impacts. However, the nature of this phenomenon in developing countries still requires attention and traction in literature. Therefore, this study sought to highlight some of the characteristics of urban sprawl from the perspective of a developing country by juxtaposing the Ghanaian and the U.S. versions of urban sprawl as way of also stimulating further discussions in this direction. The study found out that though there are similarities in the causes and impacts of urban sprawl in both Ghana and the U.S., the socioeconomic conditions as well as cultural systems in both countries play significant roles in the evolution and perception of the phenomenon in both countries.},

abstract = {The article aims to identify the factors behind a series of center-left electoral victories in the 2002 and 2006 state elections, which indicate the decay of state political machines in Brazil's poorest regions. It is argued that vertical competition between the federal and state governments in the provision of public policies works as a constraint on state bosses' strategies of political control. The withering of state political machines may be understood as an indirect consequence of the national political shifts represented by the rise of Brazil's most important left-wing organization—the Workers' Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores)—to the presidency in 2002 and 2006. Social and economic policies implemented by the federal government under PT rule undermined subnational patron-client networks by improving the life conditions of the poorest sections of the electorate. The article explores the interlinking of national and subnational electoral dynamics by developing statistical models for state- and municipal-level data. , Este trabalho procura identificar os fatores por tr{\'{a}}s de da s{\'{e}}rie de vit{\'{o}}rias obtidas por coaliz{\~{o}}es de centro-esquerda nas elei{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es estaduais de 2002 e 2006, que indicam a decad{\^{e}}ncia das m{\'{a}}quinas pol{\'{i}}ticas estaduais nas regi{\~{o}}es mais pobres do Brasil. O artigo argumenta que a competi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o vertical entre os governos federal e estadual na provis{\~{a}}o de pol{\'{i}}ticas p{\'{u}}blicas limita as estrat{\'{e}}gias de controle pol{\'{i}}tico dos chefes estaduais.

As pol{\'{i}}ticas econ{\^{o}}micas e sociais implementadas pelo governo do PT solaparam as redes clientelistas estaduais, levando {\`{a}} melhoria das condi{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es de vida do eleitorado mais pobre.

abstract = {Where elections are costly but accountability mechanisms are weak, politicians often turn to private firms for illicit election finance. Where firms are highly regulated, politicians can exchange policy discretion or regulatory forbearance for bribes and monetary transfers from firms. Due to its regulatory intensity, we focus on the role of the construction sector. Specifically, we argue that builders will experience a short-term liquidity crunch as elections approach because of their need to re-route funds to politicians as a form of indirect election finance. We use variation in the demand for cement to investigate the presence of an electoral cycle in building activity in India consistent with this logic. Using a novel monthly-level dataset, we demonstrate that cement consumption does exhibit a political business cycle consistent with our hypothesis. Additional tests provide confidence in the robustness and interpretation of our findings.},

abstract = {Standing at the crossroads of politics, administration, economy, and society, the study of clientelism has unfolded in three waves of research since the 1960s. While initially research considered clientelism to be mainly a vestige of early modern development, later research has been intrigued by its systemic persistence and continuous organizational change. A review of the most recent wave of research on political clientelism traces some of its major paradigmatic and conceptual trends and shifts, addresses its institutional viability under democracy and market economy, and delineates the future direction of research on the institutional contexts favoring or constraining it.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {During the 1990s, the Argentine federal government dramatically increased the number of workfare programs targeted to the unemployed. The distribution of employment programs, however, varied across provinces. Previous studies suggest that this uneven distribution has taken place because politicians have not distributed programs according to formal eligibility criteria, but rather, in a clientelistic manner to entice voters' support. I conduct a balanced pooled time series analysis for twenty-four provinces for the period 1993-2002 and find that partisanship, institutional features of the Argentine federal system, social mobilization, and economic factors strongly determine the way in which presidents have distributed employment programs. The results challenge the assumption that these programs have been exclusively used as clientelistic handouts to buy people's votes, and point to the necessity of looking at institutional, social, and economic variables to better understand the criteria used by federal politicians to distribute means-tested programs. /// Durante los a{\~{n}}os noventa, el gobierno nacional argentino ha incrementado en forma dram{\'{a}}tica el n{\'{u}}mero de programas destinado a la poblaci{\'{o}}n desempleada. Sin embargo, la distribuci{\'{o}}n de estos programas ha variado de provincia en provincia. Diversos estudios se{\~{n}}alan que esta distribuci{\'{o}}n desigual ha sido posible debido a que los funcionarios no han distribuido los programas de acuerdo a criterios formales de idoneidad, sino m{\'{a}}s bien, de forma clientelar para obtener el respaldo de los votantes. Utilizando una serie temporal para 24 provincias durante el per{\'{i}}odo 1993-2002, este art{\'{i}}culo demuestra que el color partidario, los aspectos institucionales del federalismo argentino, la movilizaci{\'{o}}n social, y ciertos factores econ{\'{o}}micos han determinado la forma en que los presidentes han distribuido dichos programas de empleo. Los resultados que se presentan cuestionan el presupuesto seg{\'{u}}n el cual estos programas se han utilizado exclusivamente como moneda de cambio para comprar votos, y se{\~{n}}alan la importancia de incorporar variables institucionales, sociales y ec{\'{o}}nomicas para entender de forma m{\'{a}}s acabada el criterio con el cual los funcionarios nacionales distribuyen programas focalizados.},

@article{DeLaO2011,
abstract = {This article reexamines the argument that targeted programs increase pro-incumbent voting by persuading beneficiaries to cast ballots against their first partisan choice. The evidence comes from the randomized component of Progresa, the pioneering Mexican conditional cash transfer (CCT) program. Experimental data show that early enrollment in the program led to substantive increases in voter turnout and in the incumbent's vote share in the 2000 presidential election. The experiment also reveals that opposition parties' vote shares were unaffected by the program. Thus, the electoral bonus generated by CCTs may be best explained by a mobilizing rather than persuasive mechanism. These findings are difficult to reconcile with the notion that the electoral effects of CCTs are a result of prospective concerns triggered by threats of program discontinuation or endogenous program enrollment. Instead, the evidence in this article suggests that CCTs' mobilizing effects are compatible with programmatic politics.},

abstract = {This paper offers a first comprehensive account of popular voting intentions in Africa's new electoral democracies. With reference to aggregate and survey data from 16 countries, this paper shows that competitive elections in Africa are more than mere ethnic censuses or simple economic referenda. Instead, Africans engage in bothethnic andeconomic voting. Not surprisingly, people who belong to the ethnic group in power intend to support the ruling party, in contrast to those who feel a sense of discrimination against their cultural group. But, to an even greater extent, would-be voters in Africa consider policy performance, especially the government's perceived handling of unemployment, inflation, and income distribution. Moreover, a full account of the intended vote choice in Africa also requires recognition that citizens are motivated – sincerely or strategically – by partisan considerations; they vote for established ruling parties because they expect that incumbents will win. This paper shows that voters attempt to associate themselves with prospective winners because they wish to gain access to material benefits and to avoid retribution after the election. These dynamics are most evident in African countries where dominant parties restrict the range of electoral choice.},

It identified state penetration, standardisation, and accommodation as key processes in the state- and nation-building sequence. This article analyses these three processes in Western Europe in the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries, and the role of public services therein, to explore how they may help us to understand the success and failure of state- and nation-building in developing countries and fragile states.},

abstract = {lientelism is common in developing countries, and often detrimentally affects political accountability and public good provision. However, little is known about how clientelistic equilibria break down, particularly because reforms that could reduce voter dependence on incumbents for special favors may also cause vot- ers to reward the reform's architects. Exploiting Mexico's federal structure and changes in incumbency over time, we separate these countervailing effects in the context of a federal land titling program that reached nearly 2.16 million urban households over 35 years. We find that municipal incumbents, who were not responsible for the program's implementation but often rely on weak property rights to enforce clientelistic exchanges, experience a large and persistent decrease in their vote share in electoral precincts where the program was implemented. The clientelistic capacity of future federal incumbents is diminished to a lesser degree. However, we show that this loss is more than compensated for by the lasting increase in the implementing federal incumbent's vote share among the land titling program's beneficiaries. Aligned municipal incumbents also success- fully claim credit, receiving a smaller boost that partially offsets their loss of clientelistic capacity. These results thus demonstrate that major programmatic reforms can both reduce clientelism while also rewarding incumbents for their policies in office. ∗We},

It argues that women workers have gained from the scheme primarily because of the paid employment opportunity, and benefits have been realised through income-consumption effects, intra-household effects, and the enhancement of choice and capability. Women have also gained to some extent in terms of realisation of equal wages under the NREGS, with long-term implications for correcting gender skewness and gender discriminatory wages prevalent in the rural labour market of India. Despite the difficulties and hurdles for women, prospects lie, inter alia, in their collective mobilisation, more so in laggard states.},

abstract = {The heart of the equilibrium selection theory of Harsanyi and Selten (1988, A General Theory of Equilibrium Selection in Games, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press) is given by the tracing procedure, a mathematical construction that adjusts arbitrary prior beliefs into equilibrium beliefs. Although the term "procedure" suggests a numerical approach, the tracing procedure itself is a nonconstructive method. In this paper we propose a homotopy algorithm that generates a path of strategies. By using lexicographic pivoting techniques, it can be shown that for the entire class of noncooperative N-person games, the path converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium, even when the starting point or the game is degenerate. The outcome of the algorithm is shown to be arbitrarily close to the equilibrium beliefs proposed by the tracing procedure. Therefore, the algorithm does not compute just any Nash equilibrium, but one with a sound game-theoretic underpinning. Like other homotopy algorithms, it is easily implemented on a computer.

abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of television and radio on social capital in Indonesia. I use two sources of variation in signal reception—one based on Indonesia's mountainous terrain, and a second based on the differential introduction of private television throughout Indonesia. I find that increased signal reception, which leads to more time watching television and listening to the radio, is associated with less participation in social organizations and with lower self-reported trust. Improved reception does not affect village governance, at least as measured by discussions in village meetings and by corruption in village road projects. (JEL L82, O15, Z13)},

Munda disengagement with the state results from a complex combination of their contrasting the state with the sacral polity, historical experience of exploitation by state officers, and social relations with rural elites who, seeking to maintain dominance, reproduce Munda imaginings. The article thus draws attention to multiple co-existing notions of politics and the importance of a local political economy in the social production of cultural imaginings of the state. Long},

abstract = {Political scientists often turn to natural experiments to draw causal inferences with observational data. Recently, the regression discontinuity design (RD) has become a popular type of natural experiment due to its relatively weak assumptions. We study a special type of regression discontinuity design where the discontinuity in treatment assignment is geographic. In this design, which we call the Geographic Regression Discontinuity (GRD) design, a geographic or administrative boundary splits units into treated and control areas, and analysts make the case that the division into treated and control areas occurs in an as-if random fashion. We show how this design is equivalent to a standard RD with two running variables, but we also clarify several methodological differences that arise in geographical contexts. We also offer a method for estimation of geographically located treatment effects that can also be used to validate the identification assumptions using observable pretreatment characteristics. We illustrate our methodological framework with a re-examination of the effects of political advertisements on voter turnout during a presidential campaign, exploiting the exogenous variation in the volume of presidential ads that is created by media market boundaries.},

It analyzes municipal-level electoral results and survey data and employs matching techniques to reduce causal inference problems typical of observational studies. Results show that CCTs are associated with increased performance by the incumbent party presidential candidate in all three elections but that these effects have been reaped by incumbents from different parties. It also shows that CCTs have had no discernible impacts on party identification and the performance of incumbent parties in legislative elections. Together, these findings suggest that CCTs are significant in the short run, but lack the capacity to induce substantial long-termvoter realignments.},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

We examine the effect of institutional change on the productivity performance of African agriculture. Our central finding is that institutional change in the form of competitive presidential elections has played an important role in driving a resurgence of productivity growth. The emergence of electoral competition in Africa changed policymakers' incentives, resulting in both sectoral and macroeconomic policy reforms favorable to agriculture, following decade of policy discrimination against agriculture. These reforms, to varying degrees, contributed to an acceleration of productivity growth in African agriculture. {\$}\backslash{\$}r{\$}\backslash{\$}n},

Kumlin's theoretical framework incorporates insights from a multitude of research traditions--including research on voting behavior, social psychology, rational choice theory, political psychology, and institutional theory. The theoretical contribution is matched by a close examination of surveys of trust in government and support for democracy measures showing that people's views are constructed and influenced by their experiences with and assessments of public services and welfare state provisions--including health services, schools, transportation, and income programs like pensions, student aid, and unemployment insurance. This book will be valuable to political scientists and sociologists studying public opinion, political participation, and welfare state politics.},

abstract = {The strong support that African presidents retain among voters of their own ethnicity, despite clear evidence of shirking and corruption, has prompted numerous empirical investigations into whether an incumbent's ethnicity or performance is more important to African voters. The model of vote choice underlying almost all of these studies is additive and implies that either coethnicity or good performance can increase a candidate's vote share. However, there is little theoretical justification for such a model. In the dominant theory of ethnic voting in Africa, coethnicity is a signal of better outcomes, indicating that ethnicity and performance are not separate considerations. Using an experiment that is designed to determine how Ugandan voters make choices, the author shows that the effects of coethnicity and good performance interact: neither attribute increases support for a candidate in the absence of the other. Though previous analyses indicate that, all else being equal, voters always prefer coethnics, this study demonstrates that coethnics only have an advantage when they are not shirkers. Additionally, though previous studies indicate that voters always prefer good performers, this analysis shows that voters are indifferent to the performance of non-coethnic candidates. The article provides evidence that this pattern is in fact a result of voters' beliefs that they will only receive future goods from coethnics, making a demonstrated ability to provide such goods relevant for the electability of coethnic candidates, but not for non-coethnics. Since a large number of African voters do not share the ethnicity of their incumbent, this finding has troubling implications for accountability of African leaders.},

abstract = {We examine the mechanics of deterrence and intervention when fear is a motive for conflict. We contrast results obtained in a complete information setting, where coordination is easy, to those obtained in a setting with strategic risk, where players have different assessments of their environment. These two strategic settings allow us to define and distinguish predatory and preemptive incentives as determinants of conflict. We show that while weapons have an unambiguous deterrent effect under complete information, this does not hold anymore under strategic risk. Rather, we find that increases in weapon stocks can have a non-monotonic effect on the sustainability of peace. We also show that under strategic risk, inequality in military strength can ac- tually facilitate peace and that anticipated peace-keeping interventions may improve incentives for peaceful behavior.},

abstract = {What makes political regimes rise, endure, and fall? The main question is whether the observed close relation between levels of economic development and the incidence of democratic regimes is due to democracies being more likely to emerge or only more likely to survive in the more developed countries. We answer this question using data concerning 135 countries that existed at any time between 1950 and 1990. We find that the level of economic development does not affect the probability of transitions to democracy but that affluence does make democratic regimes more stable. The relation between affluence and democratic stability is monotonic, and the breakdown of democracies at middle levels of development is a phenomenon peculiar to the Southern Cone of Latin America. These patterns also appear to have been true of the earlier period, but dictatorships are more likely to survive in wealthy countries that became independent only after 1950. We conclude that modernization need not generate democracy but democracies survive in countries that are modern.},

Plebiscites resulted in dramatically higher satisfaction among villagers, increased knowledge about the project, greater perceived benefits, and higher reported willingness to contribute. Changing the political mechanism had much smaller effects on the actual projects selected, with some evidence that plebiscites resulted in projects chosen by women being located in poorer areas. The results suggest that direct participation in political decision making can substantially increase satisfaction and legitimacy.},

abstract = {Both advocates and critics of decentralization assume that decentralization invariably increases the power of subnational governments. However, a closer examination of the consequences of decentralization across countries reveals that the magnitude of such change can range from substantial to insignificant. In this article, I propose a sequential theory of decentralization that has three main characteristics: (1) it defines decentralization as a process, (2) it takes into account the territorial interests of bargaining actors, and (3) it incorporates policy feedback effects. I argue that the sequencing of different types of decentralization (fiscal, administrative, and political) is a key determinant of the evolution of intergovernmental balance of power. I measure this evolution in the four largest Latin American countries and apply the theory to the two extreme cases (Colombia and Argentina). I show that, contrary to commonly held opinion, decentralization does not necessarily increase the power of governors and mayors},

abstract = {Every great city has its bohemias and its hobohemias; its gold coast and little Sicilies; its rooming-house areas and its slums. In Chicago, and on the Lower North Side, they are in close physical proximity to one another. This gives one an interesting illustration of the situation in which the physical distances and the social distances do not coincide; a situation in which people who live side by side are not, and – because of the divergence of their interests and their heritages – cannot, even with the best of good will, become neighbors. – Harvey Warren Zorbaugh, The Gold Coast and the Slum, 1929 1 When an " L " train on Chicago's Red Line emerges from beneath the Loop heading south, it rumbles above the streets for a distance, then slips between the northbound and southbound lanes of the Dan Ryan Expressway, just south and east of the enclave of Chinatown. For the rest of its journey, the passengers have a view of the mighty expanse of South Chicago on both sides of them. Taking this train on my morning journeys to teach, I would read the Chicago Tribune, using the journey to keep up with the news. As we traveled south, around the time we reached US Cellular Field, where the White Sox baseball team plays, I would often put down my paper and marvel at the scenes to the east, across the northbound traffic lanes. Hulking over the expressway were the scarred and burned structures of Stateway Gardens, part of the massive expanse of public housing known as the " State Street Corridor " stretching along State Street from north to south. 2 In the collective American imagination, these projects were the epitome of public housing – decrepit, large, dangerous, Black. They stood right along the expressway so that people traveling to the North Side of the city, where most white people were probably going, could not help but see them. The projects had scars of fire coming out some of the windows, like permanent black eyes. The buildings seemed larger than they actually were – perhaps just because they were so ominous – and seemed closer than they actually were, 142},

@article{Thelen2004b,
abstract = {Summary: Thelen argues, in contrast to the punctuated equilibrium models that are advocated in path dependency theory, scholarship has to acknowledge how institutions are renegotiated periodically without drastic change (213), also called “constant causes”. Thelen proposes framing issues using two concepts – institutional layering (partial renegotiation of some elements of a given set of institutions while leaving others in place) and conversion (where existing institutions are redirected to new purposes, driving changes in the role that they perform or the function they serve) (226). Method: Thelen outlines a categorical framework for institutional evolution arguments through three approaches to institutional creation and change: functionalist, power distributionist, and cultural, including brief country-based case examinations as examples. Important Insight: Aptly, Thelen recognises the role of “losers” in the institutional evolution process as actors who do not necessary disappear, rather they adapt while perhaps not “embracing and reproducing” institutions (231). In doing so, Thelen recognises that institutional evolution and activity is a “repetitive game” in the rational choice language. Critique: At the outset of the article Thelen states that the critical junctures or exogenous shock explanations of institutional change are more prevalent than the “constant causes” explanations, however, she does not discuss the use of exogenous shocks by the elites to mask change through institutional layering and conversion. Notes key point: In order to appreciate fully the causal weight of the past, we need to complement analyses of path dependence and punctuated equilibrium models with conceptual tools that can capture the logic of institutional evolution and change. Specifically, we need to take account of the way in which crises or turning points can be generated endogenously, including through the working out of the logic of previous switch points. We also need to consider the way in which new problems are conceived and solutions sought are themselves products of the past rather than historical accidents (Haydu 1998) This amounts to a call for introducing somewhat more structure at the ‘front end' of the analysis of institutional development than most path dependence arguments do – by attending to the way in which historically evolved structures limit the options of political actors even at critical choice points. It also calls for injecting somewhat more agency and strategy at the ‘back end' of such arguments – by emphasizing the way in which institutions operate not just as constraints but as strategic resources for actors as they respond to changes in the political and economic contexts that present new opportunities or throw up new challenges. The issue of institutional change is an enormously complicated one, and my aim in this essay is relatively modest. I introduce two ways of conceptualizing the problem of institutional evolution that overcome the current zero-sum view of institutional innovation versus institutional reproduction that has been characteristic of much of the literature in this area to date. Key Contribution: Arguments about institutional change through layering and through conversion incorporate elements of increasing returns arguments from the path dependence literature, but they embed these elements in an analysis of ongoing political contestation over institutional outcomes. In doing so, they highlight the processes through which institutional arrangements are renegotiated periodically in ways that alter their forms and functions. ongoing theoretical work centring on the concept of path dependence by Mahoney, Pierson, and others has lent greater precision to pervious formulations based on the dual notions of ‘critical junctures' and ‘historical trajectories' (Mahoney 2000; Pierson 2000){\ldots}But path dependence as currently conceptualized tends to encourage a rather strict separation of the issue of institutional innovation and institutional reproduction. Much of the work that invokes this concept is premised on a punctuated equilibrium model that emphasizes moments of ‘openness' and rapid innovation followed by long periods of institutional stasis or ‘lock in' (e.g. Krasner, 1988). The implication is that institutions, once created, either persist or break down in the face of some kind of exogenous shock{\ldots}But what about institutional changes that fall short of breakdown (e.g. persistent communist era institutions in post-communist states), or the large cumulative effects of ongoing but often subtle changes that persist over long stretches of time (e.g. British House of Lords)? the contemporary literature on institutions does not yet offer very good conceptual or theoretical tools for addressing these phenomena{\ldots}Arguments about dynamic processes (e.g. Pierson 2000; think increasing returns arguments) tell only part of the story; they are better at articulating the mechanisms of reproduction behind particular institutions than they are at capturing the logic of institutional evolution and change. Moreover, in some cases, explaining institutional persistence itself may require us to look beyond arguments about increasing returns (specifically re: elements of institutional transformation designed to bring institutions in line with changing political, social, and economic conditions). prominent approaches that view institutions as brought about and sustained by particular, specified causal factors (with changes in the particular foundation of an institution resulting in institutional change): utilitarian-functionalist: functional requirements as the causal factor power-distributional: an underlying balance of societal or political power as the causal factor cultural-sociological: a shared understanding of what organizational forms are considered legitimate or appropriate. path dependence perspectives draw on the same causal arguments as the first three perspectives, but where they differ is that they do not necessarily look for ‘constant causes' through time and space. As Mahoney points out (2000, p 515) path dependence perspectives posit that factors responsible for the genesis of an institution may well be different from those that sustain it over time{\ldots}Institutional change is often seen to be a function of exogenous shocks that disrupt previously stable arrangements and open the door again for institutional innovation. two potentially fruitful ways forward in this debate (there are many others), which have the benefit of avoiding facile functionalist approaches that read the origins of institutions off the functions they currently perform, and are genuinely historical, looking at social processes as they unfold over time and in relation to other processes: layering involves the partial renegotiation of some elements of a given set of institutions which leaving others in place (e.g. US congress, where new coalitions which lack the support necessary to demolish an institution may simply erect a new one, see Schickler 2001) conversion involves the redirection of existing institutions to new purposes, driving changes in the role they perform and/or the functions they serve (e.g. US poverty programme used by Johnson to deal with racial tensions, see Weir 1992). tasks for future research: we must ask ourselves, even in cases of increasing return and lock-in, whether it crowds out layering or conversion. we must distinguish the types of empirical phenomena that are associated with the different modes of change (i.e. layering and conversion). in general, it may be unwise to draw to sharp distinctions in history b/w ‘settled' and ‘unsettled' times. Instead, to understand how institutions evolve, it may be more fruitful to aim for a more fine-grained analysis that seeks to identify what aspects of a specific institutional configuration are (or are not) renegotiable and under what conditions.},

abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between federal transfers and fiscal deficits in India. The system of federal transfers has been criticized on the grounds that it distorts the incentives for states to promote fiscal discipline. We analyze the relationship between transfers, state domestic product, and fiscal deficit for a panel of states during the period 1990–2010. The paper finds a positive long-run relationship and bi-directional causality between primary/gross fiscal deficits and non-plan transfers. Further, a negative long-run relationship and one-way causality between state domestic product and transfers is observed, with causality going from state product to transfers. These results are confirmed by multi-variate cointegration analysis, which finds a long-run relationship between fiscal transfers, state product per capita and the primary deficit of the states. The evidence in the paper is consistent with the system of fiscal transfers being “gap- filling.”},

abstract = {Most election fraud is not conducted centrally by incumbents but rather locally by a multitude of political operatives. How does an incumbent ensure that his agents de- liver fraud when needed and as much as is needed? We address this and related puzzles in the political organization of election fraud by studying the perverse consequences of incentive conflicts between incumbents and their local agents. These incentive con- flicts result in a herd dynamic among the agents that tends to either oversupply or undersupply fraud, rarely delivering the amount of fraud that would be optimal from the incumbent's point of view. Our analysis of the political organization of election fraud explains why fraud sometimes fails to deliver victories, why popular incumbents often preside over seemingly unnecessary fraud, and it predicts that the extent of fraud should be increasing in both the incumbent's genuine support and reported results across precincts. A statistical analysis of anomalies in precinct-level results from the 2011-12 Russian legislative and presidential elections supports our key claims.},

abstract = {Multiplicative interaction models are common in the quantitative political science literature. This is so for good reason. Institutional arguments frequently imply that the relationship between political inputs and outcomes varies depending on the institutional context. Models of strategic interaction typically produce conditional hypotheses as well. Although conditional hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative interaction models have been found to capture their intuition quite well, a survey of the top three political science journals from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of these models is often flawed and inferential errors are common. We believe that considerable progress in our understanding of the political world can occur if scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and don'ts for using multiplicative interaction models presented in this article. Only 10{\%} of the articles in our survey followed the checklist.},

abstract = {The social sciences are witnessing a growing body of multilevel theories and debates about the proper methodological tools for the analysis of multilevel data. In a recent contribution to this journal, multilevel Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) was proposed as a new methodological tool for discerning set-relational patterns in multilevel data. I argue that the presentation of multilevel QCA is erroneous in two respects. First, multilevel QCA ignores the fact that equifinal solutions entail diversity and therefore leads one to overestimate the complexity of QCA solutions. Second, the ordinary minimization procedure of truth tables that contain multilevel data yields the same solutions as multilevel QCA, but is much easier to implement. I conclude that the established inventory of QCA does not need to be extended by a special multilevel approach.},

@article{Lindert2007,
abstract = {This paper is one in a series of World Bank Working Papers that seeks to document the experience of Brazil's Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia Program. It highlights the key “nuts and bolts” of designing and implementing the BFP in Brazil's decentralized context. Like other conditional cash transfers (CCTs), the BFP seeks to help (a) reduce current poverty and inequality, by providing a minimum level of income for extremely poor families; and (b) break the intergenerational transmission of poverty by conditioning these transfers on beneficiary compliance with human capital requirements (school attendance, vaccines, pre-natal visits). The program also seeks to help empower BFP beneficiaries by linking them to other complementary services. As the largest conditional cash transfer in the developing world, the BFP has attracted significant attention both in Brazil and beyond. As such, this paper has two key audiences – and two corresponding objectives. First, the primary audience is international, given world-wide interest in the Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia Program. This international target audience thus includes: policy makers, practitioners, and potential future practitioners of CCTs working in other countries who are interested in learning more abut Brazil's experience with the BFP, particularly given its decentralized context. For this audience, the paper highlights some of the key features of the program including: • The program as a reform program, which consolidated four pre-reform programs into one, building on Brazil's decade of experience with CCTs; • The size and rapid expansion of the program, now reaching 11.1 million families (over 46 million people), making it the largest program of this type in the world; • The very impressive targeting accuracy of the program, and the recently demonstrated impacts on reducing poverty and inequality; • The implementation of the BFP in Brazil's decentralized context and the development and use of innovative performance-based management mechanisms to promote incentives for quality implementation in this context so as to overcome the “principal-agent” dilemma; • The role of the BFP as a unifying force in social policy, integrating social policy both horizontally across sectors and vertically across levels of government; and • The “natural laboratory for innovation” that has emerged in Brazil's decentralized context, for experimenting with exit policies and graduation approaches. Second, the topic is clearly of interest to audiences in Brazil. As such, we seek to document the evolution of the design and implementation of the BFP under the first Lula Administration, taking stock of the main advances and highlighting key priorities for the future, including: • Priority actions for further strengthening of the “basic architecture” of the program: strengthening conditionalities monitoring, fine-tuning targeting, expanding coverage to reduce errors of exclusion, and enhancing oversight and controls; and • Possible innovations for the graduation agenda, including: (a) enhancing educational conditionalities (via bonuses for grade completion and graduation and incentives for older children to attend school); and (b) linking BFP beneficiaries to complementary services.},

abstract = {The United States is the only western industrialized nation that fails to provide universal coverage and the only nation where health care for the majority of the population is financed by for-profit, minimally regulated private insurance companies. These arrangements leave one-sixth of the population uninsured at any given time, and they leave others at risk of losing insurance as a result of normal life course events. Political theorists of the welfare state usually attribute the failure of national health insurance in the United States to broader forces of American political development, but they ignore the distinctive character of the health care financing arrangements that do exist. Medical sociologists emphasize the way that physicians parlayed their professional expertise into legal, institutional, and economic power but not the way this power was asserted in the political arena. This paper proposes a theory of stakeholder mobilization as the primary obstacle to national health insurance. The evidence supports the argument that powerful stakeholder groups, first the American Medical Association, then organizations of insurance companies and employer groups, have been able to defeat every effort to enact national health insurance across an entire century because they had superior resources and an organizational structure that closely mirrored the federated arrangements of the American state. The exception occurred when the AFL-CIO, with its national leadership, state federations and union locals, mobilized on behalf of Medicare.},

abstract = {Received wisdom holds that the provision of vital public services necessarily improves the legitimacy of a fragile or conflict-affected state. In practice, however, the relationship between a state's performance in delivering services and its degree of legitimacy is nonlinear. Specifically, this relationship is conditioned by expectations of what the state should provide, subjective assessments of impartiality and distributive justice, the rela- tional aspects of provision, how easy it is to attribute (credit or blame) performance to the state, and the characteristics of the service. This questions the dominant institutional model, which reduces the role of services in (re)building state legitimacy to an instru- mental one. A more rounded account of the significance of service delivery for state legitimacy would look beyond the material to the ideational and relational significance of services, and engage with the normative criteria by which citizens judge them.},

Political control of public of{\textregistered}cials depends on two factors. First, free and regular elections allow citizens to discipline politiciansÐ Ðthe credible threat of losing of{\textregistered}ce in the next period compels policy makers to respond to the voters' interests. Second, and equally important, the degree of citizen information curbs the opportunities politicians may have to engage in political corruption and management. The presence of a well-informed electorate in a democratic setting explains between one-half and two-thirds of the variance in the levels of governmental performance and corruption.},

abstract = {Using a field survey, this paper examines the empowerment effects of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme on rural women in Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh. It argues that women workers have gained from the scheme primarily because of the paid employment opportunity, and benefits have been realised through income-consumption effects, intra-household effects, and the enhancement of choice and capability. Women have also gained to some extent in terms of realisation of equal wages under the NREGS, with long-term implications for correcting gender skewness and gender discriminatory wages prevalent in the rural labour market of India. Despite the difficulties and hurdles for women, prospects lie, inter alia, in their collective mobilisation, more so in laggard states.},

We explore how variation in geography can be exploited as a natural experiment and review several assumptions under which geographic natural experiments yield valid causal estimates. In particular, we focus on cases where a geographic or administrative boundary splits units into treated and control areas. The different identification assumptions we consider suggest testable implications, which we use to establish their plausibility. Our methods are illustrated with an original study of whether ballot initiatives increase turnout in Wisconsin and Ohio, which illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of causal inferences based on geographic natural experiments.},

Four to seven years after random assignment, families offered vouchers lived in safer neighborhoods that had lower poverty rates than those of the control group not offered vouchers. We find no significant overall effects of this intervention on adult economic self-sufficiency or physical health. Mental health benefits of the voucher offers for adults and for female youth were substantial. Beneficial effects for female youth on education, risky behavior, and physical health were offset by adverse effects for male youth. For outcomes exhibiting significant treatment effects, we find, using variation in treatment intensity across voucher types and cities, that the relationship between neighborhood poverty rate and outcomes is approximately linear.},

It identified state penetration, standardisation, and accommodation as key processes in the state- and nation-building sequence. This article analyses these three processes in Western Europe in the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries, and the role of public services therein, to explore how they may help us to understand the success and failure of state- and nation-building in developing countries and fragile states.},

abstract = {What drives governments with similar revenues to publicly provide very different amounts of goods for which private substitutes are available? Key examples are education and health care. Tis paper compares spending by Brazilian municipalities on pre-primary education—a good that is also provided privately—with spending on public infrastructure like parks and roads, which lacks private substitutes. Panel data from 1995–2008 reveal how the distribution of income affects public investment. Revenue is endogenous to investment outcomes, and the analysis addresses this problem by exploiting a 1998, nationwide education finance reform and several revisions to the policy. Te author constructs a variable that captures exogenous variation in revenue generated by nonlinearities of the law to instrument for observed revenue. Municipalities with higher median income and more inequality are less likely to allocate revenue to education or to expand pre-primary enrollment. Tey are more likely to allocate revenue to public infrastructure. Tere is suggestive evidence that this occurs for two reasons, hypothesized in two separate literatures. In rich and unequal municipalities, fewer total people support public education spending (the collective choice channel), and also, any given poor person wanting public education has less influence over policymakers there (the political power channel).},

We analyze MTO's impacts on children's long-term outcomes using tax data. We find that moving to a lower-poverty neighborhood when young (before age 13) increases college attendance and earnings and reduces single parenthood rates. Moving as an adolescent has slightly negative impacts, perhaps because of disruption effects. The decline in the gains from moving with the age when children move suggests that the duration of exposure to better environments during childhood is an important determinant of children's long-term outcomes.

abstract = {This article reexamines the argument that targeted programs increase pro-incumbent voting by persuading beneficiaries to cast ballots against their first partisan choice. The evidence comes from the randomized component of Progresa, the pioneering Mexican conditional cash transfer (CCT) program. Experimental data show that early enrollment in the program led to substantive increases in voter turnout and in the incumbent's vote share in the 2000 presidential election. The experiment also reveals that opposition parties' vote shares were unaffected by the program. Thus, the electoral bonus generated by CCTs may be best explained by a mobilizing rather than persuasive mechanism. These findings are difficult to reconcile with the notion that the electoral effects of CCTs are a result of prospective concerns triggered by threats of program discontinuation or endogenous program enrollment. Instead, the evidence in this article suggests that CCTs' mobilizing effects are compatible with programmatic politics.},

This study aimed to translate the original English version of the Questionnaire to Chinese and to provide psychometric evidence on the validity and reliability of the translated version. DESIGN. Cross-sectional study. SETTING. Out-patient clinic of a non-teaching hospital in Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS. The Paediatric Allergic Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire was translated to Chinese and then completed by a group of 115 Hong Kong Chinese children (66 male and 49 female; mean age, 11 years) with allergic disease(s). All subjects were asked to respond using visual analogue scales dealing with issues related to the perceived morbidity of allergic diseases. To assess test-retest reliability, 2 weeks later a subgroup of 16 individuals was retested with the same Questionnaire. RESULTS. The internal consistency of the Chinese Paediatric Allergic Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire was satisfactory (Cronbach alpha=0.92). The correlation between the total Questionnaire score and the visual analogue scale score was moderately significant (Spearman's rho=0.49; 95{\$}\backslash{\$}{\%} confidence interval, 0.34-0.62). Structural validity as studied by confirmatory factor analysis found that the structure of subscales was remarkably similar to the original English version. The intra-class correlation between the Questionnaire score from the first and the second test in the subgroup of 16 subjects was 0.75, indicating adequate repeatability. CONCLUSION. The validity and reliability of the Chinese version of the Paediatric Allergic Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire was established for clinical use.},

Social capital may also be produced from below, but external allies still turn out to be crucial in the ability of such organizations to survive.

A 1993 law reserved leadership positions for women in randomly selected village councils. Using 8,453 surveys of adolescents aged 11–15 and their parents in 495 villages, we find that, compared to villages that were never reserved, the gender gap in aspirations closed by 25{\%} in parents and 32{\%} in adolescents in villages assigned to a female leader for two election cycles. The gender gap in adolescent educational attainment is erased and girls spent less time on household chores. We find no evidence of changes in young women's labor market opportunities, suggesting that the impact of women leaders primarily reflects a role model effect.},

abstract = {This paper examines how the adoption of the Australian ballot (AB), and ipso facto, the transition from the nominal to effective secret vote, shaped the nature of party politics in Brazil. To address this issue, the paper utilizes an original dataset—painstakingly assembled from regional electoral archives—containing municipal-level vote returns for federal deputy and senate contests during the period before and after the AB's introduction in Brazil (1958-1962). The dataset exploits the fact that the AB was in- troduced at different times in different states and for different offices in the country, thereby creating an unprecedented opportunity to assess the impact of this institu- tion. Using a triple difference-in-difference procedure, the study finds that the AB: 1) shifted the ideological balance of power from Right to Left; 2) did not greatly weaken the hand of local vote brokers; and 3) greatly increased the proportion of wasted votes cast in elections},

abstract = {Low administrative capacity and pervasive corruption constrain the performance of social insurance programs in many low - income settings. The increasing availability of e - governance, i.e. , the application of information and communication technology f or delivering public services, makes it possible to design mechanisms with fewer agents intermediating the delivery process. Do such redesigns reduce leakages by reducing the number of potential bribe - takers , or worsen performance by reducing oversight on local implementing agencies? We evaluate the impact of a reform in the delivery of funds for a large public employment program, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). The reform was implemented in 69 blocks randomly select ed from 12 districts of Bihar with a total rural population of 33 million. The reform reduced the set of agents involved in the wage payment process and, alongside, empowered the village - level agents by increasing their ability to directly request and proc ess wage payments. During the seven months of the intervention, program expenditures dropped by approximately 25{\%} in the treatment blocks as compared to the control. However, household survey data shows similar levels of employment in treatment and control blocks. Survey data also indicates that payments to MGNREGS workers were delayed, but not cut, especially in the first four months of the intervention when numerous implementation issues arose . Our findings are consistent with reduced leakage of MGNREGS f unds: we show that incidence of ghost beneficiaries declined in treatment blocks. We provide qualitative evidence that intermediary bureaucrats who were excluded by the fund - flow reform had previously used control over the fund flow to collect bribes, and actively opposed the new financial architecture. Finally, the reform presents a mechanism to link fund releases to reported expenditure. We find that this intervention contributed to a significant decrease in the amount required by implementation agencies to achieve similar program outcomes. This result suggests that better cash management systems can achieve significant reductions in program costs.},

abstract = {The effect of ethnicity on party politics in Nigeria (1999–present) has been paradoxical. Policies designed to end ethnic outbidding and the ethnicisation of party politics have resulted in higher levels of ethnic violence. Policies pursued by the Nigerian framers to ‘get the party system right' and engender broad, ethnically diverse parties were also expected to reduce the incentives for elites to encourage ethnic violence. They have not. The Peoples' Democratic Party (PDP) succeeds as a multi-ethnic coalition on the basis of informal bargains and accommodations. The practice of ‘zoning', which distributes the spoils of office according to an ethnic formula, produces incentives for local elites to embark upon ethnic violence or ethnic mobilisation as a way of advancing the interests of their local constituencies. The institutional framework of Nigerian democracy creates incentives for ‘two-faced' elites – cooperative nationally, but ethnically antagonistic in their home districts.},

abstract = {That the high growth-rising inequality phenomenon – experienced by many high growth developing economies in the recent past – may lead to discontent among the poor is a well-discussed issue. This paper argues that as the demand for higher quality of the public services rises with income, the rising income in the hands of the rich leads to their dissatisfaction about the quality of available public services, thereby inducing them to form their own club for self-provision of the public services whenever possible. This, however, results in a lowering of quality available to the others outside the club despite less crowding at the publicly provided facilities.},

Combining contemporary individual-level survey data with histori- cal data on slave shipments by ethnic group, we find that individuals whose ancestors were heavily raided during the slave trade are less trusting today. Evidence from a variety of identification strategies suggests that the relationship is causal. Examining causal mecha- nisms, we show that most of the impact of the slave trade is through factors that are internal to the individual, such as cultural norms, beliefs, and values.},

abstract = {Building on a recent analysis of total factor productivity growth in African agriculture, this paper revisits the political economy underpinnings of policies affecting agriculture. We examine the effect of institutional change on the productivity performance of African agriculture. Our central finding is that institutional change in the form of competitive presidential elections has played an important role in driving a resurgence of productivity growth. The emergence of electoral competition in Africa changed policymakers' incentives, resulting in both sectoral and macroeconomic policy reforms favorable to agriculture, following decade of policy discrimination against agriculture. These reforms, to varying degrees, contributed to an acceleration of productivity growth in African agriculture. {\$}\backslash{\$}r{\$}\backslash{\$}n},

abstract = {This article presents a model of information manipulation and political regime change. There is a regime that can be overthrown but only if enough citizens participate in an uprising. Citizens are imperfectly informed about the regime's ability to resist an uprising and the regime can engage in propaganda that, taken at face-value, makes the regime seem stronger than it truly is. This coordination game with endogenous information manipulation has a unique equilibrium and the article gives a complete analytic characterization of the equilibrium's comparative statics. Holding fixed the number of signals available to citizens, if the per-unit signal precision is sufficiently high then the regime is harder to overthrow. In contrast, if the number of signals increases, so that both total signal precision and the regime's costs of manipulation rise together, then the regime is easier to overthrow unless there are strong economies of scale in information control.

abstract = {This volume analyzes the function of informal institutions in Latin America and how they support or weaken democratic governance. Drawing from a wide range of examples—including the Mexican dedazo, clientelism in Brazil, legislative "ghost coalitions" in Ecuador, and elite power-sharing in Chile—the contributors examine how informal rules shape the performance of state and democratic institutions, offering fresh and timely insights into contemporary problems of governability, "unrule of law," and the absence of effective representation, participation, and accountability in Latin America. The editors present this analysis within a fourfold conceptual framework: complementary institutions, which fill gaps in formal rules or enhance their efficacy; accommodative informal institutions, which blunt the effects of dysfunctional formal institutions; competing informal institutions, which directly subvert the formal rules; and substitutive informal institutions, which replace ineffective formal institutions.},

abstract = {A set of point events, such as locations of disease cases, accidents, crimes, and emergency calls for instance, usually exhibits a spatial point pattern of random, clustered, or uniform nature. It is important to rely on simple and rapid methods to detect not only whether such patterns exhibit clustering, but also where clustering occurs. In the case of crime mapping, knowing where clusters are located, along with their intensity, can assist in planning safety measures to better protect an area. This article overviews techniques for point pattern analysis, which are usually supported by a geographic information system (GIS). Methods for visual exploration of point patterns and analysis of clustering are discussed. The issue of scale is of paramount importance insofar as it strongly affects the results of point patterns analyses. A sensitivity analysis that evaluates the effect of scale on the resulting point pattern is desirable.},

Daniels' seminal 1987 review, it has become widelyaccepted that the source of this dissimilarity is a variance component called nonshared environment. Theauthors review the conceptual foundations of nonshared environment, with emphasis on distinctionsbetween components of environmental variance and causal properties of environmental events andbetween the effective and objective aspects of the environment. A statistical model of shared andnonshared environmental variables is developed. A quantitative review shows that measured nonsharedenvironmental variables do not account for a substantial portion of the nonshared variability posited bybiometric studies of behavior. Other explanations of the preponderance of nonshared environmentalvariability are suggested.},

abstract = {Despite pronounced reductions in the number of deaths due to infectious diseases over the past six decades, infectious diseases are still a public health problem in Brazil. In this report, we discuss the major successes and failures in the control of infectious diseases in Brazil, and identify research needs and policies to further improve control or interrupt transmission. Control of diseases such as cholera, Chagas disease, and those preventable by vaccination has been successful through efficient public policies and concerted efforts from different levels of government and civil society. For these diseases, policies dealt with key determinants (eg, the quality of water and basic sanitation, vector control), provided access to preventive resources (such as vaccines), and successfully integrated health policies with broader social policies. Diseases for which control has failed (such as dengue fever and visceral leishmaniasis) are vector-borne diseases with changing epidemiological profiles and major difficulties in treatment (in the case of dengue fever, no treatment is available). Diseases for which control has been partly successful have complex transmission patterns related to adverse environmental, social, economic, or unknown determinants; are sometimes transmitted by insect vectors that are difficult to control; and are mostly chronic diseases with long infectious periods that require lengthy periods of treatment.},

abstract = {How do social contracts come into being? This paper argues that norm adoption plays an important and neglected role in this process. Using novel data from urban Nigeria, we examine why individuals adopt norms favoring a citizen obligation to pay tax where state enforcement is weak. We find that public goods delivery by the state produces the willingness to pay tax, but community characteristics also have a strong and independent effect on both social contract norms and actual tax payment. Individuals are less likely to adopt pro-tax norms if they have access to community provision of security and other services. In conflict-prone communities, where “self-help” provision of club goods is less effective, individuals are more likely to adopt social contract norms. Finally, we show that social contract norms substantially boost tax payment. This paper has broad implications for literatures on state formation, taxation, clientelism, and public goods provision.},

The Vietnam War featured the most intense bombing campaign in military history and had massive humanitarian costs. We use a unique U.S. military dataset containing bombing intensity at the district level (N = 584) to assess whether the war damage led to persistent local poverty traps. We compare the heavily bombed districts to other districts controlling for district demographic and geographic characteristics, and use an instrumental variable approach exploiting distance to the 17th parallel demilitarized zone. U.S. bombing does not have negative impacts on local poverty rates, consumption levels, infrastructure, literacy or population density through 2002. This finding indicates that even the most intense bombing in human history did not generate local poverty traps in Vietnam. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Under certain circumstances, the etiology of endogenous institutional change lies in the informal coping strategies devised by local actors to evade the restrictions of formal institutions. With repetition and diffusion, these informal coping strategies may take on an institutional reality of their own. The author calls the resulting norms and practices adaptive informal institutions because they represent creative responses to formal institutional environments that actors find too constraining. Adaptive informal institutions may then motivate elites to reform the original formal institutions. This contention is illustrated by three major institutional changes that have occurred in the course of China's private sector development since the late 1970s-the legalization of private enterprise, the admission of capitalists into the Chinese Communist Party, and the amendment of the state constitution to promote the private economy.},

abstract = {In choosing strategies of state capture (the extraction of private benefits by incumbent officeholders from the state), rulers choose whether to share rents with popular constituencies and whether to tolerate competition. These choices are conditioned by existing organizational endowments, the costs of buying support, and the trade-off between the cost and probability of exit from office. In turn, both rent distribution and competition result in distinct configurations of state capture: clientelism, predation, fusion, exploitation, and the formation of specific state institutions and capacities.},

Affirmative action increases the black share of employees over time: in 5 years after an establishment is first regulated, the black share of employees increases by an average of 0.8 percentage points. Strikingly, the black share continues to grow at a similar pace even after an establishment is deregulated. I argue that this persistence is driven in part by affirmative action inducing employers to improve their methods for screening potential hires. (JEL J15, J23, J24, J83, K31)},

abstract = {For obtaining causal inferences that are objective, and therefore have the best chance of revealing scientific truths, carefully designed and executed randomized experiments are generally considered to be the gold standard. Observational studies, in contrast, are generally fraught with problems that compromise any claim for objectivity of the resulting causal inferences. The thesis here is that observational studies have to be carefully designed to approximate randomized ex-periments, in particular, without examining any final outcome data. Often a candidate data set will have to be rejected as inadequate be-cause of lack of data on key covariates, or because of lack of overlap in the distributions of key covariates between treatment and control groups, often revealed by careful propensity score analyses. Some-times the template for the approximating randomized experiment will have to be altered, and the use of principal stratification can be helpful in doing this. These issues are discussed and illustrated using the framework of potential outcomes to define causal effects, which greatly clarifies critical issues. 1. Randomized experiments versus observational studies. 1.1. Historical dichotomy between randomized and nonrandomized stud-ies for causal effects. For may years, causal inference based on randomized experiments, as described, for example, in classic texts by Fisher (1935), Kempthorne (1952), Cochran and Cox (1950) and Cox (1958), was an en-tirely distinct endeavor than causal inference based on observational data sets, described, for example, in texts by Blalock},

It extends the citizen-candidate model of democratic policy-making to a dynamic
environment. Equilibrium policy choices are shown to be efficient in the sense
that in each period, conditional on future policies being selected through the
democratic process, there exists no alternative current policy choices which can
raise the expected utilities of all citizens. However, policies that would be declared
efficient by standard economic criteria are not necessarily adopted in
political equilibrium. The paper argues that these divergencies are legitimately
viewed as "politicalfailures."},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {Throughout much of mankind's experience with elections, vote brokers - local elites who direct the voting decisions of a subset of the electorate - have been able to make or break political careers. In various polities, brokers have thrived in spite of the secret ballot, a surprising outcome given that vote secrecy would ostensibly allow citizens to pocket the inducements offered by such individuals and vote their consciences anyway. To address this puzzle, we develop a framework for understanding the persistence and demise of vote brokerage under the secret ballot. In our model, a broker contracts with voters using an outcome contingent contract: some fixed benefit is promised to all voters sharing one of several observable profiles should the broker's candidate win the election. Using this framework, we demonstrate that the existence of brokerage depends on the size of the electorate contained within the jurisdiction controlled by the broker, with large jurisdiction sizes tending to drive brokerage out of existence. Moreover, we detail the manner in which the strategies employed by brokers depend on their economic power, the size of social groups, and ideological polarization. Empirical evidence from Minas Gerais, Brazil is used to evaluate the performance of the model.

abstract = {We provide evidence on the effect of market illegality on violence. Brazil was historically the main exporter of mahogany. Starting in the 1990s, trade was restricted and eventually prohibited. We build on previous evidence that mahogany trade persisted after prohibition and document relative increases in violence in areas with natural occurrence of mahogany. We show that as illegal activity receded in the late 2000s so did the relative increase in violence. We describe an experience of increase in violence following the transition of a market from legal to illegal and contribute to the evaluation of prohibition policies under limited enforcement.

@article{Campos2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the randomized controlled trial (RCT) is widely considered the most reliable method for evaluation of health care interventions, challenges to both internal and external validity exist. Thus, the efficacy of an intervention in a trial setting does not necessarily represent the real-world performance that decision makers seek to inform comparative effectiveness studies and economic evaluations. METHODS: Using data from the ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study (ALTS), we performed a simplified economic evaluation of age-based management strategies to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) among women who were referred to the study with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL). We used data from the trial itself to adjust for 1) potential lead time bias and random error that led to variation in the observed prevalence of CIN3 by study arm and 2) potential ascertainment bias among providers in the most aggressive management arm. RESULTS: We found that using unadjusted RCT data may result in counterintuitive cost-effectiveness results when random error and/or bias are present. Following adjustment, the rank order of management strategies changed for 2 of the 3 age groups we considered. CONCLUSIONS: D ecision analysts need to examine STUDY DESIGN: , available trial data, and cost-effectiveness results closely in order to detect evidence of potential bias. Adjustment for random error and bias in RCTs may yield different policy conclusions relative to unadjusted trial data.},

Results The meta-analysis included 59 509 857 subjects in nine cohort studies and 1 280 211 subjects in 19 cross sectional studies. The overall cohort relative risk and cross sectional odds ratio (95{\%} confidence intervals) per 0.05 unit increase in Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, was 1.08 (1.06 to 1.10) and 1.04 (1.02 to 1.06), respectively. Meta-regressions showed stronger associations between income inequality and the health outcomes among studies with higher Gini ({\textgreater}or=0.3), conducted with data after 1990, with longer duration of follow-up ({\textgreater}7 years), and incorporating time lags between income inequality and outcomes. By contrast, analyses accounting for unmeasured regional characteristics showed a weaker association between income inequality and health. Conclusions The results suggest a modest adverse effect of income inequality on health, although the population impact might be larger if the association is truly causal. The results also support the threshold effect hypothesis, which posits the existence of a threshold of income inequality beyond which adverse impacts on health begin to emerge. The findings need to be interpreted with caution given the heterogeneity between studies, as well as the attenuation of the risk estimates in analyses that attempted to control for the unmeasured characteristics of areas with high levels of income inequality.},

abstract = {Prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer in males in Western countries. The reported incidence in Asian countries is much lower than that in African Americans and European Caucasians. Although the lack of systematic prostate cancer screening system in Asian countries explains part of the difference, this alone cannot fully explain the lower incidence in Asian immigrants in the United States and west-European countries compared to the black and non-Hispanic white in those countries, nor the somewhat better prognosis in Asian immigrants with prostate cancer in the United States. Soy food consumption, more popular in Asian populations, is associated with a 25{\$}\backslash{\$}{\%} to 30{\$}\backslash{\$}{\%} reduced risk of prostate cancer. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the only established and routinely implemented clinical biomarker for prostate cancer detection and disease status. Other biomarkers, such as urinary prostate cancer antigen 3 RNA, may increase accuracy of prostate cancer screening compared to PSA alone. Several susceptible loci have been identified in genetic linkage analyses in populations of countries in the West, and approximately 30 genetic polymorphisms have been reported to modestly increase the prostate cancer risk in genome-wide association studies. Most of the identified polymorphisms are reproducible regardless of ethnicity. Somatic mutations in the genomes of prostate tumors have been repeatedly reported to include deletion and gain of the 8p and 8q chromosomal regions, respectively; epigenetic gene silencing of glutathione S-transferase Pi (GSTP1); as well as mutations in androgen receptor gene. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis, aggressiveness, and prognosis of prostate cancer remain largely unknown. Gene-gene and/or gene-environment interactions still need to be learned. In this review, the differences in PSA screening practice, reported incidence and prognosis of prostate cancer, and genetic factors between the populations in East and West factors are discussed.},

abstract = {Every great city has its bohemias and its hobohemias; its gold coast and little Sicilies; its rooming-house areas and its slums. In Chicago, and on the Lower North Side, they are in close physical proximity to one another. This gives one an interesting illustration of the situation in which the physical distances and the social distances do not coincide; a situation in which people who live side by side are not, and – because of the divergence of their interests and their heritages – cannot, even with the best of good will, become neighbors. – Harvey Warren Zorbaugh, The Gold Coast and the Slum, 1929 1 When an " L " train on Chicago's Red Line emerges from beneath the Loop heading south, it rumbles above the streets for a distance, then slips between the northbound and southbound lanes of the Dan Ryan Expressway, just south and east of the enclave of Chinatown. For the rest of its journey, the passengers have a view of the mighty expanse of South Chicago on both sides of them. Taking this train on my morning journeys to teach, I would read the Chicago Tribune, using the journey to keep up with the news. As we traveled south, around the time we reached US Cellular Field, where the White Sox baseball team plays, I would often put down my paper and marvel at the scenes to the east, across the northbound traffic lanes. Hulking over the expressway were the scarred and burned structures of Stateway Gardens, part of the massive expanse of public housing known as the " State Street Corridor " stretching along State Street from north to south. 2 In the collective American imagination, these projects were the epitome of public housing – decrepit, large, dangerous, Black. They stood right along the expressway so that people traveling to the North Side of the city, where most white people were probably going, could not help but see them. The projects had scars of fire coming out some of the windows, like permanent black eyes. The buildings seemed larger than they actually were – perhaps just because they were so ominous – and seemed closer than they actually were, 142},

abstract = {Three studies investigated the implicit constructions of reality associated with cultural differences in enemyship (personal relationship of hatred, malice, and sabotage). Results of interview (Study 1; N = 98) and questionnaire (Study 2; N = 166) research indicated that enemyship was more prominent among Ghanaian participants than among U.S. participants. Additional evidence located a potential source of these differences in different constructions of relationship. Responses linked the prominence of enemyship to constructions of relationship as inherent, enduring connection (interdependent models). Responses linked the sense of freedom from enemyship to constructions of relationship as the discretionary product of atomistic selves (independent models). An experiment among Ghanaian participants (Study 3; N = 48) provided evidence that increasing experience of inherent connection can be sufficient to increase accessibility of enemyship. Results help to illuminate the cultural grounding of personal relationship and other phenomena that are typically invisible in mainstream theory and research.},

abstract = {In this article we show that changes in the support base for Lula that become more evident in the 2006 elections are best explained by political variables. For this we turn to an original database, aggregated at the ballot station level, and we extend the analysis including other parties and elections preceding that election. On the one hand, an explanation of what happened in 2006 needs to explain what happened in 2002, which is when the PT reaches the presidency. On the other hand, given the compositional character of the vote, the explanation of what happens to the votes of the PT should explain what happens to the votes of his opponents. We note that the success of the PT and the expansion of its base from 2006 occur after the implosion of the PSDB in 2002 and the absence of competitive opponents. Explanations based on the advantages brought by the coming of PT to power do not give an accurate account of these dynamics. We suggest that a better explanation should focus on the pree- election coordination strategies adopted by the parties.},

@article{Bossert2011a,
abstract = {Health sector decentralization has been widely adopted to improve delivery of health services. While many argue that institutional capacities and mechanisms of accountability required to transform decentralized decision-making into improvements in local health systems are lacking, few empirical studies exist which measure or relate together these concepts. Based on research instruments administered to a sample of 91 health sector decision-makers in 17 districts of Pakistan, this study analyzes relationships between three dimensions of decentralization: decentralized authority (referred to as " decision space" ), institutional capacities, and accountability to local officials. Composite quantitative indicators of these three dimensions were constructed within four broad health functions (strategic and operational planning, budgeting, human resources management, and service organization/delivery) and on an overall/cross-function basis. Three main findings emerged. First, district-level respondents report varying degrees of each dimension despite being under a single decentralization regime and facing similar rules across provinces. Second, within dimensions of decentralization-particularly decision space and capacities-synergies exist between levels reported by respondents in one function and those reported in other functions (statistically significant coefficients of correlation ranging from {\$}\rho{\$}= 0.22 to {\$}\rho{\$}= 0.43). Third, synergies exist across dimensions of decentralization, particularly in terms of an overall indicator of institutional capacities (significantly correlated with both overall decision space ({\$}\rho{\$}= 0.39) and accountability ({\$}\rho{\$}= 0.23)). This study demonstrates that decentralization is a varied experience-with some district-level officials making greater use of decision space than others and that those who do so also tend to have more capacity to make decisions and are held more accountable to elected local officials for such choices. These findings suggest that Pakistan's decentralization policy should focus on synergies among dimensions of decentralization to encouraging more use of de jure decision space, work toward more uniform institutional capacity, and encourage greater accountability to local elected officials. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Using a qualitative research method based on a comparison of two poverty alleviation strategies in Latin America, this article asserts that in all likelihood, if a previously implemented policy initiative was 'locked-in' through domestic policy experimentation and resultant state-building and interest group policy effects, it will not easily be replaced by alternative, transnational policy ideas that appear on the radar screen of national policymakers at a later date. However, if transnational policy ideas and models can draw on or build upon already established ideational and symbolic beliefs, they can actually be used to further the motivations of key political actors and societal interests - here, diffusion opens up great reform opportunities and opens the door to further policy institutionalization. {\textcopyright}The Author(s) 2013.},

For sceptics, this move within inclusive neoliberalism is inevitably depoliticising and disempowering, and our cases do suggest that citizenship-based strategies rarely alter the underlying basis of poverty. However, our evidence also offers some support to those optimists who suggest that progressive moves towards poverty reduction and citizenship formation have become more rather than less likely at the current juncture. The promotion of citizenship emerges here as a significant but incomplete effort to challenge poverty that persists over time.},

abstract = {Because insurgent group formation typically occurs in secrecy and in poorly monitored areas, the empirical record on conflicts' start is spare and systematically omits rebels who fail before committing substantial violence. This article argues that this presents a fundamental challenge for the study of conflict onset and demonstrates the theoretical and empirical problems it causes in studying a controversial relationship: how ethnicity influences armed conflicts' start. Unusual evidence on all armed groups that formed in Uganda since 1986 indicates that ethnic mobilization was unimportant to the initial formation of rebel groups—but mattered after nascent groups had already formed. Contrasting evidence from Uganda with a prominent argument that ethnic marginalization induces rebellion shows why lack of evidence about how insurgencies begin can lead to broader inferential pitfalls.},

abstract = {Choice-Based Conjoint (CBC) has been the most widely used conjoint technique among our user base since about the year 2000. The marketing research community has adopted CBC enthusiastically, for several reasons. Choice tasks seem to mimic what actual buyers do more closely than ranking or rating product concepts as in conventional conjoint analysis. Choice tasks seem easy for respondents, and everyone can make choices. And equally important, multinomial logit analysis provides a well-developed statistical model for estimating respondent part-worths from choice data. However, choice tasks are less informative than tasks involving ranking or rating of product concepts. For this reason, CBC studies have typically required larger sample sizes than ratings-based conjoint methods. In CBC studies, the respondent must examine the characteristics of several product concepts in a choice set, each described on several attributes, before making a choice. Yet, that choice reveals only which product was preferred, and nothing about strength of preference, or the relative ordering of the non- preferred concepts. Initially, CBC questionnaires of reasonable length offered too little information to support multinomial logit analysis at the individual level. More recently, hierarchical Bayes methods have been developed which do permit individual-level analysis, but interest has remained in ways to design choice tasks so as to provide more information.},

abstract = {In a recent contribution to this journal, Munck and Snyder found that many studies suffer from a deficient application of qualitative and quantitative methods. They argue that the combination of small-n and large-n analysis represents a viable method for promoting the production of knowledge. Recently, Evan Lieberman proposed nested analysis as a rigorous approach for comparative research that builds on the complementary strengths of quantitative and qualitative analysis. In this paper, the author examines the methodological potential of nested inference to advance comparative political analysis, arguing that the specific methodological problems of nested designs have not been fully appreciated. It is shown that, under certain circumstances, nothing is gained from a nested analysis. On the contrary, one might lose more than one gains compared to single-method designs. The author suggests specific methodological principles that take these problems into account to make nested analysis fruitful for comparative studies.},

However, even when natural interventions are randomly assigned, some of the treatment–control comparisons made available by natural experiments may not be valid. We offer a framework for clarifying the issues involved, which are subtle and often overlooked. We illustrate our framework by examining four different natural experiments used in the literature. In each case, random assignment of the intervention is not sufficient to provide an unbiased estimate of the causal effect. Additional assumptions are required that are problematic. For some examples, we propose alternative research designs that avoid these conceptual difficulties.},

We review the evidence on corruption in developing countries in light of these recent advances, focusing on three questions: how much corruption is there, what are the efficiency consequences of corruption, and what determines the level of corruption? We find robust evidence that corruption responds to standard economic incentive theory but also that the effects of anticorruption policies often attenuate as officials find alternate strategies to pursue rents.},

abstract = {lientelism is common in developing countries, and often detrimentally affects political accountability and public good provision. However, little is known about how clientelistic equilibria break down, particularly because reforms that could reduce voter dependence on incumbents for special favors may also cause vot- ers to reward the reform's architects. Exploiting Mexico's federal structure and changes in incumbency over time, we separate these countervailing effects in the context of a federal land titling program that reached nearly 2.16 million urban households over 35 years. We find that municipal incumbents, who were not responsible for the program's implementation but often rely on weak property rights to enforce clientelistic exchanges, experience a large and persistent decrease in their vote share in electoral precincts where the program was implemented. The clientelistic capacity of future federal incumbents is diminished to a lesser degree. However, we show that this loss is more than compensated for by the lasting increase in the implementing federal incumbent's vote share among the land titling program's beneficiaries. Aligned municipal incumbents also success- fully claim credit, receiving a smaller boost that partially offsets their loss of clientelistic capacity. These results thus demonstrate that major programmatic reforms can both reduce clientelism while also rewarding incumbents for their policies in office. ∗We},

While literature oil political clientelism focuses on explanatory factors like lack of political credibility, political machines capable of effective monitoring, autonomy of brokers, high levels of poverty, and political competiveness, the role of institutions has been overlooked. While the existing literature suggests that political clientelism is all optimal strategy in the context of weak institutions, the present analysis finds that the institution of the office of Member of Parliament in Ghana is strong, but shaped by informal norms in ways that favour the provision of private goods in clientelistic networks. The analysis also points to theoretical lessons oil how political clientelism call endogenously undermine the conditions for its own existence.},

abstract = {Efforts to engage citizens in democratic forms of governance in developing societies are complicated by deeply rooted socioeconomic and political inequalities. In this article, the authors analyze the conditions under which local politicians in rural areas of Latin America are likely to open up to citizen participation in governance decisions. The analytical approach focuses on the incentive structures of local politicians under both decentralized and centralized regimes. The argument is that, regardless of regime type, participatory governance institutions are more likely to emerge when the goals of these institutions are compatible with the interests of the local executive. The authors test the argument by analyzing patterns of interaction between central and local governance actors in 390 municipal governments in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Peru. They find that local politicians' incentive structures explain a great deal as to why local governments decide to invite citizens to take part in governance activities.},

abstract = {Results from a new experiment shed light on the effects of voter informa-tion on vote buying and incumbent advantage. The treatment provided voters with information about a major spending program and the proposed alloca-tions and promises of mayoral candidates just prior to municipal elections. It left voters more knowledgeable about candidates' proposed policies and in-creased the salience of spending, but did not affect vote shares and turnout. Treated voters were more likely to be targeted for vote buying. We develop a model of vote buying that accounts for these results. The information raised voter expectations regarding incumbent performance, especially in incumbent strongholds. Incumbents increased vote buying in response. Consistent with this explanation, both knowledge and vote buying impacts were higher in incumbent-dominated municipalities. Our findings show that, in a political environment where vote buying is the currency of electoral mobilization, in-cumbent efforts to increase voter welfare may take the form of greater vote buying.},

A clear trend decline in the percentage of people who are absolutely poor is evident, although with uneven progress across regions. We find more mixed success in reducing the total number of poor. Indeed, the developing world outside China has seen little or no sustained progress in reducing the number of poor, with rising poverty counts in some regions, notably sub-Saharan Africa. There are encouraging signs of progress in all regions after 2000, although it is too early to say whether this is a new trend. We also summarize results from estimating a new series incorporating an allowance for the higher cost of living facing poor people in urban areas. This reveals a marked urbanization of poverty in the developing world, which is stronger in some regions than others, although it remains that three-quarters of the poor live in rural areas.},

While exogenous asymmetric information has been shown to select a unique equilibrium, we show that the endogenous information generated by policy interventions leads to multiple equilibria. The policy maker is thus trapped into a position in which self‐fulfilling expectations dictate not only the coordination outcome but also the optimal policy. This result does not rely on the freedom to choose out‐of‐equilibrium beliefs, nor on the policy being a public signal; it may obtain even if the policy is observed with idiosyncratic noise.

New examples of how ill-conceived or deliberately contrived statistical maps can greatly distort geographic reality demonstrate that lying with maps is a special case of lying with statistics. Issues addressed include the effects of map scale on geometry and feature selection, the importance of using a symbolization metaphor appropriate to the data and the power of data classification to either reveal meaningful spatial trends or promote misleading interpretations.},

abstract = {Global games are games of incomplete information whose type space is determined by the players each observing a noisy signal of the underlying state. With strategic complementarities, global games often have a unique, dominance solvable equilibrium, allowing analysis of a number of economic models of coordination failure. For symmetric binary action global games, equilibrium strategies in the limit (as noise becomes negligible) are simple to characterize in terms of `diffuse' beliefs over the actions of others. We describe a number of economic applications that fall in this category. We also explore the distinctive roles of public and private information in this setting, review results for general global games, discuss the relationship between global games and a literature on higher order beliefs in game theory and describe the relationship to local interaction games and dynamic games with payoff shocks.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{\$}\alpha{\$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA}for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {A systematic review of the literature to assess the effectiveness of alcohol tax policy interventions for reducing excessive alcohol consumption and related harms was conducted for the Guide to Community Preventive Services (Community Guide). Seventy-two papers or technical reports, which were published prior to July 2005, met specified quality criteria, and included evaluation outcomes relevant to public health (e.g., binge drinking, alcohol-related crash fatalities), were included in the final review. Nearly all studies, including those with different study designs, found that there was an inverse relationship between the tax or price of alcohol and indices of excessive drinking or alcohol-related health outcomes. Among studies restricted to underage populations, most found that increased taxes were also significantly associated with reduced consumption and alcohol-related harms. According to Community Guide rules of evidence, these results constitute strong evidence that raising alcohol excise taxes is an effective strategy for reducing excessive alcohol consumption and related harms. The impact of a potential tax increase is expected to be proportional to its magnitude and to be modified by such factors as disposable income and the demand elasticity for alcohol among various population groups.},

abstract = {Voter turnout theories based on rational self-interested behavior generally fail to predict significant turnout unless they account for the utility that citizens receive from performing their civic duty. We distinguish between two aspects of this type of utility, intrinsic satisfaction from behaving in accordance with a norm and extrinsic incentives to comply, and test the effects of priming intrinsic motives and applying varying degrees of extrinsic pressure. A large-scale field experiment involving several hundred thousand registered voters used a series of mailings to gauge these effects. Substantially higher turnout was observed among those who received mailings promising to publicize their turnout to their household or their neighbors. These findings demonstrate the profound importance of social pressure as an inducement to political participation.},

These policies have affected the lives of millions{\$}\backslash{\$}nof people, yet our most sophisticated political economy models do not adequately capture{\$}\backslash{\$}ninfluences on these policy choices. Evidence suggests that the adoption of liberal economic practices{\$}\backslash{\$}nis highly clustered both temporally and spatially. We hypothesize that this clustering might be due to{\$}\backslash{\$}nprocesses of policy diffusion.We think of diffusion as resulting from one of two broad sets of forces: one{\$}\backslash{\$}nin which mounting adoptions of a policy alter the benefits of adopting for others and another in which{\$}\backslash{\$}nadoptions provide policy relevant information about the benefits of adopting. We develop arguments{\$}\backslash{\$}nwithin these broad classes of mechanisms, construct appropriate measures of the relevant concepts, and{\$}\backslash{\$}ntest their effects on liberalization and restriction of the current account, the capital account, and the{\$}\backslash{\$}nexchange rate regime. Our findings suggest that domestic models of foreign economic policy making{\$}\backslash{\$}nare insufficient. The evidence shows that policy transitions are influenced by international economic{\$}\backslash{\$}ncompetition as well as the policies of a country's sociocultural peers.We interpret the latter influence as a{\$}\backslash{\$}nform of channeled learning reflecting governments' search for appropriate models for economic policy.},

abstract = {Recently, the regression discontinuity (RD) design has become increasingly popular among social scientists. One prominent application is the study of close elections. We explicate several methodological misunderstandings widespread across disciplines by revisiting the controversy concerning the validity of RD design when applied to close elections. Although many researchers invoke the local or as-if-random assumption near the threshold, it is more stringent than the required continuity assumption. We show that this seemingly subtle point determines the appropriateness of various statistical methods and changes our understanding of how sorting invalidates the design. When multiple-testing problems are also addressed, we find that evidence for sorting in US House elections is substantially weaker and highly dependent on estimation methods. Finally, we caution that despite the temptation to improve the external validity, the extrapolation of RD estimates away from the threshold sacrifices the design's advantage in internal validity.},

We present data collected in controlled experiments with 2939 subjects in 30 countries measur- ing risk and uncertainty attitudes through incentivized measures as well as survey questions. Our data show clearly that measures correlate not only within deci- sion contexts or measurement methods, but also across contexts and methods. This points to the existence of one underlying ‘risk preference', which influences attitudes independently of the measurement method or choice domain. We furthermore find that answers to a general and a financial survey question correlate with incentivized lottery choices in most countries. Incentivized and survey measures also correlate significantly between countries. This opens the possibility to conduct cultural com- parisons on risk attitudes using survey instruments.},

The literature on voters in Africa tells us that ballots are won over by clientelism rather than economic development, thus undermining the quality of collective goods provision and democratic accountability. We challenge this notion drawing insight from the December 2008 Ghanaian elections in which the National Democratic Congress came back to power after eight years as an opposition party. Using two surveys carried out before and after the elections, we analyse voters' retrospective sanctioning and prospective selection of incumbent and opposition candidates for legislative office. Our findings show that vote-buying and purely clientelistic appeals are insufficient to win elections and that Ghanaian voters value development when choosing political leaders and hold influential retrospective evaluations of performance. The evidence suggests that clientelism as an electoral strategy may be ubiquitous in emerging democracies, but as voters gain greater experience in choosing political leaders and longer-term information about retrospective performance, its utility may diminish over time.},

abstract = {Use of indifference curves, defined as functionality between development index and pollution load to evaluate environmental impact, is proposed. Existing Battelle environmental evaluation methodology is subjective in its approach. The use of indifference curves lends a more objective approach to environment assessment methodology. The extent of environmental damage we are prepared to accept, for a development, can be explained by Willingness to Pay and Willingness to Accept approach. The application of proposed approach has been demonstrated taking an example of Power plant set up in forest area. The curves clearly show that cost of EMP considering mitigation of ecological damage is higher than the EMP mitigating impacts of air and water pollution only. The example stresses the need for willingness to accept along with willingness to pay.},

Large-N quantitative appraoches are discussed for each selection procedure along with their advantages and drawbacks. Oldest technique is most-similar (usually stronger than most different) and authors present matching as a new strategy to identify cases. Also presents strategies for dealing with shifts from exploratory to confirming research designs.},

abstract = {Political scientists often turn to natural experiments to draw causal inferences with observational data. Recently, the regression discontinuity design (RD) has become a popular type of natural experiment due to its relatively weak assumptions. We study a special type of regression discontinuity design where the discontinuity in treatment assignment is geographic. In this design, which we call the Geographic Regression Discontinuity (GRD) design, a geographic or administrative boundary splits units into treated and control areas, and analysts make the case that the division into treated and control areas occurs in an as-if random fashion. We show how this design is equivalent to a standard RD with two running variables, but we also clarify several methodological differences that arise in geographical contexts. We also offer a method for estimation of geographically located treatment effects that can also be used to validate the identification assumptions using observable pretreatment characteristics. We illustrate our methodological framework with a re-examination of the effects of political advertisements on voter turnout during a presidential campaign, exploiting the exogenous variation in the volume of presidential ads that is created by media market boundaries.},

It is now recognized that large-scale participation is possible even without selective incentives, but this has raised new questions. I discuss two types of contributions from the past few years. Some of the recent literature has remained close to the canonical game-theoretic framework, clarifying many analytical issues and proving important results in participation games that had remained elusive. We now know that the ?turnout paradox? had been grossly overstated. Another set of contributions has expanded the original framework, incorporating results from psychology and social sciences with the aim of obtaining more realistic models with better empirical performance.},

abstract = {In the past three decades, Brazil has undergone rapid changes in major social determinants of health and in the organisation of health services. In this report, we examine how these changes have affected indicators of maternal health, child health, and child nutrition. We use data from vital statistics, population censuses, demographic and health surveys, and published reports. In the past three decades, infant mortality rates have reduced substantially, decreasing by 5{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} a year in the 1980s and 1990s, and by 4{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} a year since 2000 to reach 20 deaths per 1000 livebirths in 2008. Neonatal deaths account for 68{\%} of infant deaths. Stunting prevalence among children younger than 5 years decreased from 37{\%} in 1974-75 to 7{\%} in 2006-07. Regional differences in stunting and child mortality also decreased. Access to most maternal-health and child-health interventions increased sharply to almost universal coverage, and regional and socioeconomic inequalities in access to such interventions were notably reduced. The median duration of breastfeeding increased from 2{\textperiodcentered}5 months in the 1970s to 14 months by 2006-07. Official statistics show stable maternal mortality ratios during the past 10 years, but modelled data indicate a yearly decrease of 4{\%}, a trend which might not have been noticeable in official reports because of improvements in death registration and the increased number of investigations into deaths of women of reproductive age. The reasons behind Brazil's progress include: socioeconomic and demographic changes (economic growth, reduction in income disparities between the poorest and wealthiest populations, urbanisation, improved education of women, and decreased fertility rates), interventions outside the health sector (a conditional cash transfer programme and improvements in water and sanitation), vertical health programmes in the 1980s (promotion of breastfeeding, oral rehydration, and immunisations), creation of a tax-funded national health service in 1988 (coverage of which expanded to reach the poorest areas of the country through the Family Health Program in the mid-1990s); and implementation of many national and state-wide programmes to improve child health and child nutrition and, to a lesser extent, to promote women's health. Nevertheless, substantial challenges remain, including overmedicalisation of childbirth (nearly 50{\%} of babies are delivered by caesarean section), maternal deaths caused by illegal abortions, and a high frequency of preterm deliveries.},

abstract = {We analyze an evolutionary model with a finite number of players and with noise or mutations. The expansion and contraction of strategies is linked-as usual-to their current relative success, but mutations-which perturb the system away from its deter- ministic evolution-are present as well. Mutations can occur in every period, so the focus is on the implications of ongoing mutations, not a one-shot mutation. The effect of these mutations is to drastically reduce the set of equilibria to what we term "long-run equilibria." For 2 x 2 symmetric games with two symmetric strict Nash equilibria the equilibrium selected satisfies (for large populations) Harsanyi and Selten's (1988) criterion of risk-dominance. In particular, if both strategies have equal security levels, the Pareto dominant Nash equilibrium is selected, even though there is another strict Nash equilib- rium},

abstract = {Three studies investigated the implicit constructions of reality associated with cultural differences in enemyship (personal relationship of hatred, malice, and sabotage). Results of interview (Study 1; N = 98) and questionnaire (Study 2; N = 166) research indicated that enemyship was more prominent among Ghanaian participants than among U.S. participants. Additional evidence located a potential source of these differences in different constructions of relationship. Responses linked the prominence of enemyship to constructions of relationship as inherent, enduring connection (interdependent models). Responses linked the sense of freedom from enemyship to constructions of relationship as the discretionary product of atomistic selves (independent models). An experiment among Ghanaian participants (Study 3; N = 48) provided evidence that increasing experience of inherent connection can be sufficient to increase accessibility of enemyship. Results help to illuminate the cultural grounding of personal relationship and other phenomena that are typically invisible in mainstream theory and research.},

abstract = {Mexico is reaching universal health coverage in 2012. A national health insurance programme called Seguro Popular, introduced in 2003, is providing access to a package of comprehensive health services with financial protection for more than 50 million Mexicans previously excluded from insurance. Universal coverage in Mexico is synonymous with social protection of health. This report analyses the road to universal coverage along three dimensions of protection: against health risks, for patients through quality assurance of health care, and against the financial consequences of disease and injury. We present a conceptual discussion of the transition from labour-based social security to social protection of health, which implies access to effective health care as a universal right based on citizenship, the ethical basis of the Mexican reform. We discuss the conditions that prompted the reform, as well as its design and inception, and we describe the 9-year, evidence-driven implementation process, including updates and improvements to the original programme. The core of the report concentrates on the effects and impacts of the reform, based on analysis of all published and publically available scientific literature and new data. Evidence indicates that Seguro Popular is improving access to health services and reducing the prevalence of catastrophic and impoverishing health expenditures, especially for the poor. Recent studies also show improvement in effective coverage. This research then addresses persistent challenges, including the need to translate financial resources into more effective, equitable and responsive health services. A next generation of reforms will be required and these include systemic measures to complete the reorganisation of the health system by functions. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the Mexican quest to achieve universal health coverage and its relevance for other low-income and middle-income countries.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract The idea that democratic states have not fought and are not likely to fight interstate wars against each other runs counter to the realist and neorealist theoretical traditions that have dominated the field of international politics. Since the mid-1970s, the generation of new data and the development of superior analytical techniques have enabled evaluators of the idea to generate impressive empirical evidence in favor of the democratic peace proposition, which is reinforced by substantial theoretical elaboration. Some critics argue that common interests during the Cold War have been primarily responsible for peace among democracies, but both statistical evidence and intuitive arguments cast doubt on that contention. It has also been argued that transitions to democracy can make states war-prone, but that criticism too has been responded to persuasively. The diverse empirical evidence and developing theoretical bases that support the democratic peace proposition warrant confidence in its validity.},

The article{\$}\backslash{\$}nseeks to understand why the role of occupational welfare in Israel{\$}\backslash{\$}nis so formidable and to examine the implications of this. Its focus{\$}\backslash{\$}nis upon the crucial role that the labor movement played in the formation{\$}\backslash{\$}nof this system during a critical juncture in the evolution of the{\$}\backslash{\$}nIsraeli welfare state. During the 1950s, the Israeli labor movement{\$}\backslash{\$}nbrought about the establishment of an extensive system of occupational{\$}\backslash{\$}nwelfare and a social security system for the elderly based primarily{\$}\backslash{\$}nupon low universal state benefits and generous voluntary occupational{\$}\backslash{\$}nbenefits.

abstract = {This article presents a new methodology for multilevel analysis using a small number of cases, named Comparative Multilevel Analysis (CMA). A classic problem in comparative studies has been the presence of too many variables and too few cases. One traditional solution to this problem has been to study subsystems within a system. However, the approach has fundamental limitations: it cannot analyse subsystems from different contexts, nor can it determine how conditions on the system level influence subsystems. By proposing four additions to traditional methodology, this article offers a new method of comparing subsystems from different contexts in order to analyse the effect of context on subsystems. The author also illustrates how CMA can be combined with Qualitative Comparative Analysis and Fuzzy-set, thereby enabling these methods to be used in the study of subsystem and context effects.},

abstract = {Do controlled comparisons still have a place in comparative politics? Long criticized by quantitatively oriented methodologists, this canonical approach has increasingly been critiqued by qualitative methodologists who recom- mend greater focus on within-case analysis and the confinement of causal explanations to particular cases. Such advice accords with a welcome shift from a combative “tale of two cultures” toward mutual respect for research combining qualitative and quantitative methods in the simultaneous pursuit of internal and external validity. This article argues that controlled comparisons remain indispensable amid this “multimethod turn,” explicating how they too can generate both internal and external validity when their practitioners (a) craft arguments with general variables or mechanisms, (b) seek out rep- resentative variation, and (c) select cases that maximize control over alterna- tive explanations. When controlled comparisons meet these standards, they continue to illuminate the world's great convergences and divergences across nation-states in a manner that no other methods can surpass.},

abstract = {Throughout much of mankind's experience with elections, vote brokers - local elites who direct the voting decisions of a subset of the electorate - have been able to make or break political careers. In various polities, brokers have thrived in spite of the secret ballot, a surprising outcome given that vote secrecy would ostensibly allow citizens to pocket the inducements offered by such individuals and vote their consciences anyway. To address this puzzle, we develop a framework for understanding the persistence and demise of vote brokerage under the secret ballot. In our model, a broker contracts with voters using an outcome contingent contract: some fixed benefit is promised to all voters sharing one of several observable profiles should the broker's candidate win the election. Using this framework, we demonstrate that the existence of brokerage depends on the size of the electorate contained within the jurisdiction controlled by the broker, with large jurisdiction sizes tending to drive brokerage out of existence. Moreover, we detail the manner in which the strategies employed by brokers depend on their economic power, the size of social groups, and ideological polarization. Empirical evidence from Minas Gerais, Brazil is used to evaluate the performance of the model.

abstract = {Party activists face a coordination problem: a critical mass—a barrier to coordination—must advocate a single policy alternative if the party is to succeed. The need for direction is the degree to which the merits of the alternatives respond to the underlying fundamentals of the party's environment. An individual's ability to assess the fundamentals is his sense of direction. These three factors—the barriers to coordination, the need for direction, and an individual's sense of direction—combine to form an index of both the desirability and the feasibility of leadership. We offer insights into Michels' Iron Law: a sovereign party conference gives way to leadership by an individual or oligarchy if and only if the leadership index is sufficiently high. Leadership enhances the clarity of intraparty communication, but weakens the response of policy choices to the party's environment. Our model can also be applied to the coordination problems faced by instrumental voters in plurality-rule elections, and so relates to the psychological effect of Duverger's Law.},

abstract = {Abstract We reconsider the relationship between income and health taking a distributional perspective rather than one centered on conditional expectation. Using structured additive distributional regression, we find that the association between income and health is larger than generally estimated because aspects of the conditional health distribution that go beyond the expectation imply worse outcomes for those with lower incomes. Looking at German data from the Socio-Economic Panel, we find that the risk of bad health is roughly halved when doubling the net equivalent income from 15,000 to 30,000?. This is more than tenfold of the magnitude of change found when considering expected health measures. A distributional perspective thus highlights another dimension of the income?health relation?that the poor are in particular faced with greater health risk at the lower end of the health distribution. We therefore argue that when studying health outcomes, a distributional approach that considers stochastic variation among observationally equivalent individuals is warranted.},

abstract = {When it was first published, DESIGNING SOCIAL INQUIRY, by political scientists Gary King, Robert Keohane, and Sidney Verba, at once struck chords of controversy. As it became one of the best-selling methodology books in memory, it continued to spark debate in journal articles, conference panels, and books. RETHINKING SOCIAL INQUIRY is a major new effort by a broad range of leading scholars to offer a cohesive set of reflections on DESIGNING SOCIAL INQUIRY's quest for common standards drawn from quantitative methodology. While vigorously agreeing to the need for common standards, the essays in RETHINKING SOCIAL INQUIRY argue forcefully that these standards must be drawn from exemplary qualitative research as well as the best quantitative studies. The essays make the case that good social science requires a set of diverse tools for inquiry. Key additions to the seminal pieces gathered here include an original overview of DESIGNING SOCIAL INQUIRY, a new essay on evaluating causation, and a concluding chapter that draws together basic issues in the ongoing methodological debate.},

abstract = {The mission of the academic social sciences is to understand and ameliorate society's greatest challenges. The data held by private companies hold vast potential to further this mission. Yet, because of their interaction with highly politicized issues, customer privacy, proprietary content, and differing goals of business and academia, these datasets are often inaccessible to university researchers. We propose here a model for industry-academic partnerships that addresses these problems via a novel organizational structure: Respected scholars form a commission which, as a trusted third party, receives access to all relevant company information and systems, and then invites independent academics to do research in specific areas, following standard peer review protocols, funded by nonprofit foundations, and with no required pre-publication approval by the company. We also report on a partnership we helped forge under this model to make data available about the incendiary issues surrounding the impact of social media on elections and democracy. In our first partnership, Facebook provides (privacy-preserving) data access; eight major ideologically and substantively diverse nonprofit foundations fund the research; an organization of academics we created, Social Science One, leads the project; and logistical help is provided by the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard and a respected nonprofit. 1 Draft in progress; comments welcome (send to ​ King@Harvard.edu​). The current version of this paper is available at ​ GaryKing.org/partnerships​ .},

If exposure to campaign advertising makes a potential voter significantly more likely to vote, then we should see significantly greater turnout in battleground states. We do not. This result is robust to several specifications and evident in a natural experiment consisting of New Jersey residents. Conditional on existing campaign targeting strategies, campaigns do not affect the turnout decisions of the voters we study.},

abstract = {Global games are games of incomplete information whose type space is determined by the players each observing a noisy signal of the underlying state. With strategic complementarities, global games often have a unique, dominance solvable equilibrium, allowing analysis of a number of economic models of coordination failure. For symmetric binary action global games, equilibrium strategies in the limit (as noise becomes negligible) are simple to characterize in terms of `diffuse' beliefs over the actions of others. We describe a number of economic applications that fall in this category. We also explore the distinctive roles of public and private information in this setting, review results for general global games, discuss the relationship between global games and a literature on higher order beliefs in game theory and describe the relationship to local interaction games and dynamic games with payoff shocks.},

abstract = {Descriptions of elections in Brazil have long emphasized that much of the money used in campaigns is unreported to electoral authorities. As unreported expenditures are not typically observable by scholars, academic understanding of the uses and electoral impact of political finance in Brazil is based solely upon analyses of reported expenditures, and thus remains incomplete. Drawing upon a unique dataset which documents the allocation of illicit campaign funds during a gubernatorial reelection campaign in the state of Minas Gerais in 1998, we provide the first explicit analysis of the targeting and impact of off-the-books campaign funds. As the scheme revolved around buying off scores of low-level politicians, our first step is to build a profile of the typical 'bought' politician. Secondly, we draw upon advances in the literature on program evaluation to estimate the effect that the purchase of low-level politicians had on electoral returns in the contest.},

@article{Hakkert1986,
abstract = {In 1964, at independence, Zambia's economic future looked brighter than that of most other developing countries. Its copper production accounted for 8{\%} of total world production, and only neighboring Zaire outpaced it in the production of cobalt. Its Central Province around Kabwe held rich deposits of both zinc and lead; uranium deposits also had been found, but their projected yield remained undetermined. Since 1974, the decline in the price of copper and the increase in the price of oil have played havoc with Zambia's balance of payments. Copper, which accounted for 40{\%} of the gross national product (GNP) and 98{\%} of all foreign exchange in 1964, shrank to 12{\%} of the GNP in 1978 while still generating most of the foreign exchange. As a result, imports were cut back markedly from {\$}1.5 billion in 1973 to {\$}690 million in 1983. Although this trend is beginning to make a U-turn, Zambia's economic situation is grave. In 1984 the GNP continued to register negative growth and inflation stood at 25{\%}. With its urbanization rate doubling from 21{\%} in 1964 to 43{\%} in 1985, Zambia is now the most urbanized country south of the Sahara. Zambia's 1985 population is estimated to be 6.8 million. Between 1963 and 1969, the average annual population growth rate was 2.5: it was 3.1{\%} between 1969-80. The current birthrate of about 48/1000 is expected to decline only marginally in the next 15 years, but the death rate is declining more rapidly -- from 19/1000 in the late 1960s to 15/1000 in 1985. Life expectancy is expected to rise from the current 51 years to about 58 years. As a result of the high growth rate, Zambia's population is young, with a median age of about 16.3 years. Traditional African values stress the importance of large families. Zambia's total fertility rate was 6.9 in 1985. According to the World Bank, only 1{\%} of married women of childbearing age in 1982 used contraceptives. Although tribal links are weakening, Zambia still counts 73 officially recognized tribes. Together, they speak about 40 different dialects. Zambia now apportions over 15{\%} of its national budget to education. Despite some noticeable progress, the public health structure remains deficient. Principal health problems include malaria, tuberculosis, and, in Northern Province and Luapula Province, sleeping sickness and river blindness. About 2/3 of the labor force, an estimated 2.2 million persons in 1982, still work in agriculture. Female labor force participation is lower in Zambia than in many African nations.},

abstract = {We develop and explicate a game-theoretic model in which repeated play, incomplete information, and reputation are major elements. A significant advance of this model is the way it represents cooperation under incomplete information among rational actors of different sizes. The model is used to formalize certain aspects of the @'theory of hegemonic stability.@' It shows that the @'dilemma@' or @'limits@' of hegemonic stability look like natural attributes of games where reputation is involved, unifying both @'benevolent@' and @'coercive@' strands of hegemony theory. An example, drawn from recent developments in the Organization of Petroleum-exporting Countries, shows how our model of reputation guides the study of hegemonic regime construction. We conclude by comparing the nature of cooperative behavior under conditions of complete and incomplete information.},

abstract = {In the past decade, conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs have become an important component of social policy in developing countries. While the impacts of these programs have been well researched with respect to their effectiveness to achieve intended outcomes, less is known about their impact on private expenditure decisions. This aspect has great policy relevance since changes in private household expenditures can either support or counteract the aim of the programs. This essay investigates the impact of a CCT program on private household expenditure decisions in nutrition, health and education which are seen as principal contributors to child human capital. First, household expenditure behavior under a CCT program is discussed based on Heckman's model on the technology of skill formation as a conceptual framework. The paper shows how intra-household preferences and perceptions on the substitutability or complementarity of investments can impact household resource allocation decisions. Subsequently, the theoretical implications are tested in the context of the Brazilian CCT program Bolsa Familia, using the Brazilian household expenditure survey. Evidence is found that households increase their private expenditure in food and education disproportionally to the amount of cash transfer, that is, more than would be expected when considering the Engel curves of the expenditures under question.},

abstract = {This paper combines dynamic social choice and strategic experimentation to study the following question: How does a society, a committee, or, more generally, a group of individuals with potentially heterogeneous preferences, experiment with new opportunities? Each voter recognizes that, during experimentation, other voters also learn about their preferences. As a result, pivotal voters today are biased against experimentation because it reduces their likelihood of remaining pivotal. This phenomenon reduces equilibrium experimentation below the socially efficient level, and may even result in a negative option value of experimentation. However, one can restore efficiency by designing a voting rule that depends deterministically on time. Another main result is that even when payoffs of a reform are independently distributed across the population, good news about any individual's payoff increases other individuals' incentives to experiment with that reform, due to a positive voting externality.},

abstract = {Anderson Gray McKendrick's 1926 paper, 'Applications of mathematics to medical problems', was the earliest reference cited in Dempster et al.'s 1977 paper that defined and popularized the EM algorithm. McKendrick's paper was prominently featured by Joseph Oscar Irwin in his 1962 inaugural address as the President of the Royal Statistical Society (in the UK), entitled 'The place of mathematics in medical and biological statistics'. The link of McKendrick's work to the EM algorithm is due to an improvement made by Irwin on a novel method McKendrick used for estimating an infection rate when the observed data do not distinguish between those individuals who are not susceptible to the infection and those who are susceptible, but do not develop symptoms. This article examines this link, along the way illustrating the central ideas underlying the EM algorithm as well as its properties; the examination also suggests a profiling strategy for speeding up EM, which may be worthy of general investigation. McKendrick's data on an epidemic of cholera are used for illustration and to compare EM with Irwin's method as well as the Newton-Raphson algorithm. Issues beyond computation are also discussed whenever appropriate.},

abstract = {Low administrative capacity and pervasive corruption constrain the performance of social insurance programs in many low - income settings. The increasing availability of e - governance, i.e. , the application of information and communication technology f or delivering public services, makes it possible to design mechanisms with fewer agents intermediating the delivery process. Do such redesigns reduce leakages by reducing the number of potential bribe - takers , or worsen performance by reducing oversight on local implementing agencies? We evaluate the impact of a reform in the delivery of funds for a large public employment program, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). The reform was implemented in 69 blocks randomly select ed from 12 districts of Bihar with a total rural population of 33 million. The reform reduced the set of agents involved in the wage payment process and, alongside, empowered the village - level agents by increasing their ability to directly request and proc ess wage payments. During the seven months of the intervention, program expenditures dropped by approximately 25{\%} in the treatment blocks as compared to the control. However, household survey data shows similar levels of employment in treatment and control blocks. Survey data also indicates that payments to MGNREGS workers were delayed, but not cut, especially in the first four months of the intervention when numerous implementation issues arose . Our findings are consistent with reduced leakage of MGNREGS f unds: we show that incidence of ghost beneficiaries declined in treatment blocks. We provide qualitative evidence that intermediary bureaucrats who were excluded by the fund - flow reform had previously used control over the fund flow to collect bribes, and actively opposed the new financial architecture. Finally, the reform presents a mechanism to link fund releases to reported expenditure. We find that this intervention contributed to a significant decrease in the amount required by implementation agencies to achieve similar program outcomes. This result suggests that better cash management systems can achieve significant reductions in program costs.},

abstract = {We report new estimates of measures of absolute poverty for the developing world for the period 1981-2004. A clear trend decline in the percentage of people who are absolutely poor is evident, although with uneven progress across regions. We find more mixed success in reducing the total number of poor. Indeed, the developing world outside China has seen little or no sustained progress in reducing the number of poor, with rising poverty counts in some regions, notably sub-Saharan Africa. There are encouraging signs of progress in all regions after 2000, although it is too early to say whether this is a new trend. We also summarize results from estimating a new series incorporating an allowance for the higher cost of living facing poor people in urban areas. This reveals a marked urbanization of poverty in the developing world, which is stronger in some regions than others, although it remains that three-quarters of the poor live in rural areas.},

abstract = {This article presents a new methodology for multilevel analysis using a small number of cases, named Comparative Multilevel Analysis (CMA). A classic problem in comparative studies has been the presence of too many variables and too few cases. One traditional solution to this problem has been to study subsystems within a system. However, the approach has fundamental limitations: it cannot analyse subsystems from different contexts, nor can it determine how conditions on the system level influence subsystems. By proposing four additions to traditional methodology, this article offers a new method of comparing subsystems from different contexts in order to analyse the effect of context on subsystems. The author also illustrates how CMA can be combined with Qualitative Comparative Analysis and Fuzzy-set, thereby enabling these methods to be used in the study of subsystem and context effects.},

abstract = {In " Political Devolution and Resistance to Foreign Rule, " Ferwerda and Miller (FM) use a natural experiment during WWII France to argue that devolution of authority to local elites mitigates resistance to foreign rule. We dispute FM's claims on four levels. First, the Line of Demarcation dividing France was delineated with the goal of keeping strategic railways under direct German control, invalidating FM's natural experiment research design. Second, the higher level of resistance they observe in directly occupied France results from the Resistance's efforts to target these strategic railways. Third, FM's argument is not supported by the overall pattern of resistance in metropolitan France between 1940-44. Finally, FM's data is unsuitable for testing theories connecting the location of an attack with its perpetrators' precise geographic origins. These problems lead us to argue for the epistemic priority of treatment-assignment causal process observations over balance checks on pretreatment covariates when validating natural experiments.},

abstract = {Ballot initiatives allow the public to vote directly on public policy. A literature in political science has attempted to document whether the presence of an initiative can increase voter turnout. Here, we study this question for an initiative that appeared on the ballot inMilwaukee,WI in 2008. We study this question using a natural experiment based on geography. This form of natural experiment exploits variation in geography where units in one geographic area receive a treatment while units in another area do not. The hope is that assignment to treatment via geographic location creates as-if ran- dom variation in treatment assignment. When this happens, adjustment for baseline covariates is unnecessary. In many applications, however, some adjustment for base- line covariates may be necessary. As such, analysts may wish to combine identification strategies–using both spatial proximity and covariates. We develop a matching algo- rithm to flexibly incorporate information about both the discontinuity and observed covariates which allows us to minimize spatial distance while preserving balance on observed covariates. Integrating these two strategies results in weaker assumptions for identification. Also, with this approach it is straightforward to conduct a sensitivity analysis to bias from hidden confounders.},

abstract = {Despite repeated calls for the use of “mixed methods” in comparative analysis, political scientists have few systematic guides for carrying out such work. This paper details a unified approach which joins intensive case-study analysis with statistical analysis. Not only are the advantages of each approach combined, but also there is a synergistic value to the nested research design: for example, statistical analyses can guide case selection for in-depth research, provide direction for more focused case studies and comparisons, and be used to provide additional tests of hypotheses generated from small-N research. Small-N analyses can be used to assess the plausibility of observed statistical relationships between variables, to generate theoretical insights from outlier and other cases, and to develop better measurement strategies. This integrated strategy improves the prospects of making valid causal inferences in cross-national and other forms of comparative research by drawing on the distinct strengths of two important approaches.},

abstract = {Those who study the role of agriculture in the political economy of development focus on government policy choices on the one hand and the impact of price shocks on the other. We argue that the two should be studied together. We find that civil unrest (Granger) causes government policies, pushing governments in poor and medium income countries to shift relative prices in favor of urban consumers. We also find that while civil wars are related to food price shocks, when government policy choices are taken into account, the relationship disappears. We thus learn two things: Policies that placate urban consumers may inflict economic costs on governments, but they confer political benefits. And when estimating the relationship between price shocks and political stability, equations that omit the policy response of governments are misspecified.},

abstract = {What makes African voters 'up for grabs'? Existing approaches to the swing voter have several liabilities. This article introduces a new measure enabling a more comprehensive assessment of swing voting, including the differentiation between clientelistic and collective goods motivations. The issue of swing voting is then brought to an environment where voters are rarely considered persuadable: Africa. Using a count-model estimation technique and original survey data from Ghana's critical 2008 elections, the analysis challenges the near consensus in African politics on clientelism as the only electoral strategy. When voters perceive politicians as providing collective, developmental goods, the efficacy of clientelism as a tool to win over voters is reduced. Many persuadable voters can also be won over by both clientelistic and collective goods, thus contradicting the literature presenting these as mutually exclusive. Finally, the analysis shows that incumbents do better when they provide collective goods even in highly clientelistic environments. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Over the past fifteen years, a burgeoning political science literature has explored the politics of policy feedback, showing how policies can create self-sustaining cycles of change and reconfigure the political dynamic. Yet there has been insufficient recognition of the limits of feedback. In this essay, we explore three common reasons why positive feedback might not arise after a law is enacted: weak policy design, inadequate or conflicting institutional supports, and poor timing. These conditions may be an unintended byproduct of the lawmaking process or they may stem from deliberate attempts by opponents to prevent a new policy from durably reshaping governing possibilities for the future. Drawing on a range of case examples, we discuss how the political impact of policy changes can peter out over time.},

We show that CEM possesses a wide range of statistical properties not available in most other matching methods but is at the same time exceptionally easy to comprehend and use. We focus on the connection between theoretical properties and practical applications. We also make available easy-to-use open source software for R, Stata, and SPSS that implement all our suggestions},

abstract = {Brazil's democratic constitution granted municipalities responsibility to design and implement social policies, allowing for tailored programs to meet local constituent demands. Yet instead of pursuing local diversity, many governments chose to emulate programs made famous elsewhere. What explains the diffusion of social programs across Brazil? This article investigates whether policy makers are motivated by political self-interest, ideology, or socialized norms. It draws on an event history analysis of two innovative programs that have diffused throughout Brazil's largest cities: Bolsa Escola, an education program, and Programa Sa{\'{u}}de da Fam{\'{i}}lia, a family health program. The author argues that political incentives, such as electoral competition, cannot explain diffusion. Rather, diffusion occurs when left-of-center mayors are ideologically compelled to enact these programs and when public officials with connections to professional networks are socialized to follow professional norms.},

abstract = {How can political scientists best uncover historical causation without committing infinite regress? This article introduces a revised framework for historical analysis that can help systematically capture the deepest causal factors in political development. It improves on the familiar “critical juncture” framework by specifying the precise causal or noncausal status of the “antecedent conditions” preceding critical junctures. After disaggregating antecedent conditions into four logical types, the authors argue that scholars should be especially mindful of critical antecedents: factors or conditions preceding a critical juncture that combine in a causal sequence with factors operating during that juncture to produce divergent outcomes. Through analytic reviews of a wide array of major works, the authors illustrate how critical antecedents can clarify causal claims and enhance knowledge accumulation in comparative politics.},

abstract = {What shapes politicians' strategies in political systems where pork, rather than programmatic platforms, wins elections? We argue that resource control provides much of the answer, as politics in pork-centric systems will in large part be organized around actors who control access to pork. We use new national and subnational data from Brazil and Japan to show how the degree of centralization of resources can affect party affiliation patterns. We find that in decentralized Brazil, both national and subnational politicians join parties that control their subnational government. In contrast, in our analysis of centralized Japan, politicians at both national and subnational levels base their party affiliation decisions on national-level partisan considerations},

With repetition and diffusion, these informal coping strategies may take on an institutional reality of their own. The author calls the resulting norms and practices adaptive informal institutions because they represent creative responses to formal institutional environments that actors find too constraining. Adaptive informal institutions may then motivate elites to reform the original formal institutions. This contention is illustrated by three major institutional changes that have occurred in the course of China's private sector development since the late 1970s-the legalization of private enterprise, the admission of capitalists into the Chinese Communist Party, and the amendment of the state constitution to promote the private economy.},

abstract = {This article presents a model of information manipulation and political regime change. There is a regime that can be overthrown but only if enough citizens participate in an uprising. Citizens are imperfectly informed about the regime's ability to resist an uprising and the regime can engage in propaganda that, taken at face-value, makes the regime seem stronger than it truly is. This coordination game with endogenous information manipulation has a unique equilibrium and the article gives a complete analytic characterization of the equilibrium's comparative statics. Holding fixed the number of signals available to citizens, if the per-unit signal precision is sufficiently high then the regime is harder to overthrow. In contrast, if the number of signals increases, so that both total signal precision and the regime's costs of manipulation rise together, then the regime is easier to overthrow unless there are strong economies of scale in information control.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{\$}\alpha{\$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA}for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Can formal democratic institutions succeed if they are built in societies with inhospitable social and economic conditions? In particular, will attempts to hold competitive elections fail to strengthen democracy in poor and divided nation states, as well as in regions such as the Middle East which are dominated by autocracy? Skeptics point to an earlier wave of institution building, when European-style parliaments were transplanted to many African societies during the era of decolonization, including in Benin and Togo, only to collapse as the military usurped their powers.1 We first need to establish the influence of certain underlying economic and social conditions on democratic consolidation before proceeding to examine the impact of power- sharing institutions in subsequent chapters. As Dahl points out, where the underlying conditions are highly unfavorable, then it is improbable that democracy could be preserved by any constitutional design. By contrast, if the underlying conditions are highly favorable, then democratic consolidation is likely with almost any constitution.2 But many cases fall into the muddy middle-ground. The analysis of cross-sectional time-series data illuminates the general patterns and what conditions count, focusing upon examining the role of wealth, the size of nation states, colonial legacies, regional diffusion, and the degree of ethnic heterogeneity. Each of these factors can be regarded as ‘structural' constraints on political development, meaning that it is difficult for domestic policymakers or the international community to alter these conditions in the medium to short-term, if at all; for example countries cannot change their histories or chose their neighboring states, although they can attempt to grow their economy. The East Asian cases of South Korea and Singapore provide further insights into how certain structural factors facilitate, but do not determine, democratic consolidation. Both Asian societies have experienced rapidly economic transformation in recent decades, yet South Korea has adopted multiparty elections and strengthened human rights, with the regimes rated by Freedom House as equivalent to Greece or Israel, while Singapore is rated only ‘partly free' by Freedom House. The contrasts help to explain the strengths – and limits – of socioeconomic explanations of democratization.},

abstract = {This article describes the current debate on the practice of preregistration in political science—that is, publicly releasing a research design before observing outcome data. The case in favor of preregistration maintains that it can restrain four potential causes of publication bias, clearly distinguish deductive and inductive studies, add transparency regarding a researcher's motivation, and liberate researchers who may be pressured to find specific results. Concerns about preregistration maintain that it is less suitable for the study of historical data, could reduce data exploration, may not allow for contextual problems that emerge in field research, and may increase the difficulty of finding true positive results. This article makes the case that these concerns can be addressed in preregistered studies, and it offers advice to those who would like to pursue study registration in their own work.},

Perhaps the most basic tenet of economics is that market equilibrium entails supply equalling demand; that if demand should exceed supply, prices will rise, decreasing demand and/or increasing supply until demand and supply are equated at the new equilibrium price. So if prices do their job, rationing should not exist. However, credit rationing and unemployment do in fact exist. They seem to imply an excess demand for loanable funds or an excess supply of workers.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{\$}\alpha{\$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA}for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

However, there is a paucity of research on the external validity of these methods that examines whether the determinants that explain hypothetical choices made by survey respondents match the determinants that explain what subjects actually do when making similar choices in real-world situations. This study compares results from conjoint and vignette analyses on which immigrant attributes generate support for naturalization with closely corresponding behavioral data from a natural experiment in Switzerland, where some municipalities used referendums to decide on the citizenship applications of foreign residents. Using a representative sample from the same population and the official descriptions of applicant characteristics that voters received before each referendum as a behavioral benchmark, we find that the effects of the applicant attributes estimated from the survey experiments perform remarkably well in recovering the effects of the same attributes in the behavioral benchmark. We also find important differences in the relative performances of the different designs. Overall, the paired conjoint design, where respondents evaluate two immigrants side by side, comes closest to the behavioral benchmark; on average, its estimates are within 2{\%} percentage points of the effects in the behavioral benchmark.},

abstract = {A vast literature demonstrates that voters around the world who benefit from their governments' discretionary spending cast ballots for the incumbent party in larger proportions than those not receiving funds. But contrary to most theories of politi- cal accountability, the evidence seems to indicate that voters also reward incumbent parties for implementing “programmatic” spending legislation, passed with support from all major parties, and over which incumbents have no discretion. Why voters would attribute responsibility when none exists is unclear, as is why minority party legislators would approve of legislation that will cost them votes. We address this puzzle with one of the largest randomized social experiments ever, resulting in clear rejection of the claim that programmatic policies greatly increase voter support for incumbents. We also reanalyze the study cited as claiming the strongest support for the electoral effects of programmatic policies, which is also a very large scale ran- domized experiment. We show that its key results vanish after correcting either a simple coding error affecting only two observations or highly unconventional data analysis procedures (or both). We also discuss how these consistent empirical results from the only two probative experiments on this question may be reconciled with several observational and theoretical studies touching on similar questions in other contexts.},

abstract = {A new method for measuring political clientelism is developed: the Systematic Qualitative Method (SQM). Ideal for measuring clientelism, the new method is also easily adapted to measure other kinds of social phenomena for which there is no available data. After elaborating a detailed guide for using the method, its validity is established by comparing SQM measurement of clientelism in Argentina and Brazil with existing measures found in the literature. Finally, the results of SQM measurement of clientelism in Argentina and Brazil are presented. An analysis of variation in clientelism within and across the two countries yields some hypotheses for future research.},

abstract = {In many situations in macroeconomics strategic complementarities arise, and agents face a coordination problem. An important issue, from both a theoretical and a policy perspective, is equilibrium uniqueness. We contribute to this literature by focusing on the macroeconomic aspect of the problem: the number of potential innovators, speculators, etc. is large. In particular, we follow Myerson that in large games "a more realistic model should admit some uncertainty about the number of players in the game" [Myerson, R., 1998. Population uncertainty and Poisson games. Int. J. Game Theory 27, 375-392; Myerson, R., 2000. Large Poisson games. J. Econ. Theory 94, 7-45]. In more detail, we model the coordination problem as a Poisson game, and investigate the conditions under which unique equilibrium selection is obtained. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Existing Battelle environmental evaluation methodology is subjective in its approach. The use of indifference curves lends a more objective approach to environment assessment methodology. The extent of environmental damage we are prepared to accept, for a development, can be explained by Willingness to Pay and Willingness to Accept approach. The application of proposed approach has been demonstrated taking an example of Power plant set up in forest area. The curves clearly show that cost of EMP considering mitigation of ecological damage is higher than the EMP mitigating impacts of air and water pollution only. The example stresses the need for willingness to accept along with willingness to pay.},

abstract = {It is difficult to assess countries' relative success in addressing issues of public health because countries are subject to very different background conditions. To address this problem we offer a model-based approach for assessing health system performance. Specifically, an index of public health is regressed against a vector of variables intended to capture economic, educational, cultural, geographic, and epidemiological endowments. The residual from this model is regarded as a plausible measure of public health performance at the national level. We argue that a model-based approach to performance is informative for policymakers and academics as it focuses attention on those aspects of a country's health profile that are not constrained by structural factors. This sharpens comparisons across countries and through time, and also allows one to evaluate the degree to which health systems have lived up to their potential.},

The identification strategy is based on the idea that reported earnings may be falsified, but car registries are accurate. Hidden earnings comprise over 75 percent of actual earnings of the large majority of car owners, at least twice as high as estimated in previous studies using less direct methods. There is also a lot of heterogeneity across employers. Foreign-owned firms, large firms and state-owned firms in capital-intensive industries report earnings more transparently than do small firms and firms in labor-intensive industries, where actual earnings may be more than five times higher than reported earnings. Differentials of similar magnitude are found in public services, especially among educators. Our findings shed new light on the perceived links between firm ownership, size and productivity in countries with large hidden economies.},

abstract = {Political principals face high-powered electoral pressures while bureaucrat-agents face longer term, low-powered incentives. Given constitutional constraints, what "carrots and sticks" do politicians employ to control bureaucrats and how do bureaucrats respond to such incentives? We use a simple career concerns framework and a unique dataset from the Indian Administrative Service to address these issues. State level politicians (Chief Ministers) exert control over bureaucrats when they assume office, through a novel mechanism of reassignment (transfers) to new jobs. Transfers are less likely if district politicians belong to the same party as the Chief Minister, i.e. he appears to treat local politicians and bureaucrats as substitutes. We use a framework where bureaucrats differ in their willingness to invest in job expertise or political loyalty. Consistent with this framework, we find in our data that more able bureaucrats and those with greater job-specific experience are less likely to be reassigned when a new politician assumes office. In accordance with politicians district reassignment patterns, we do not find robust evidence of any negative impact of such politically-induced transfers on development and policy outcomes at the district level.},

In the past ten years, political scientists have realized that GIS can help them address many research questions and data analysis tasks quite apart from these traditional applications. These include the analysis of point patterns and the detection of clustering; the study of diffusion of influence; and the measurement of spatial relationships involving key constructs such as proximity and distance, flow, and interaction. GIS tools also prove to be the exploratory complements to the suite of tools being used in spatial econometrics to test explicit hypotheses about the impact of geography and spatial arrangement on political outcomes.},

abstract = {In the 19th century, British and American parties competed by hiring electoral agents to bribe and treat voters. British parties abruptly abandoned this practice in the 1880s. The conventional explanation is that legislation put an end to agent-mediated distribution. But this explanation leaves many questions unanswered. Why did the parties use agents for decades, even though they imposed great expense on candidates and were viewed as untrustworthy? And why, after decades of half-hearted reforms, did the House of Commons pass effective anti-bribery reforms only in 1883? In our formal model, parties hire agents to solve information problems, but agent-mediated distribution can be collectively sub-optimal. Legislation can serve as a credibility device for shifting to less costly strategies.},

abstract = {In experimental animal studies, tumour necrosis factor-{\$}\alpha{\$} (TNF-{\$}\alpha{\$}) contributed to renal hypertrophy during diabetes, and antibodies against TNF-{\$}\alpha{\$} have led to improved histological lesions in animals with nephrotoxicity and diabetic nephropathy. We aimed to evaluate TNF-{\$}\alpha{\$} system activity in association with renal histology in patients with type 2 diabetes. This is a prospective, cross-sectional study of 22 patients with type 2 diabetes (16 men), 13 with microalbuminuria and 9 with normoalbuminuria. Plasma-soluble TNF-{\$}\alpha{\$} receptor 1 and 2 (sTNFR1 and sTNFR2) concentrations were used as surrogates of TNF-{\$}\alpha{\$} system activity. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was analysed using I(125)-Iodothalamine. Albumin excretion rate (AER) and a renal biopsy were performed in all subjects. AER did not associate significantly with mesangial expansion or interstitial fraction in these subjects (r {\textless}0.12, P {\textgreater}0.5). AER was also not associated with either sTNFR1 or sTNFR2 levels. However, after controlling for GFR, the correlation between AER and sTNFR1 became significant (r = 0.47, P = 0.03). sTNFR1 correlated with age (r = 0.65, P {\textless}0.001), mesangial expansion (r = 0.59, P = 0.004) and interstitial fraction (r = 0.58, P = 0.005). After controlling for age, body mass index and blood pressure, the association of TNFR1 with mesangial expansion persisted significant. Circulating sTNFR2 concentrations were not significantly associated with histological changes. In summary, structural kidney damage in patients with type 2 diabetes is associated with TNF-{\$}\alpha{\$} system activity and specifically with plasma sTNFR1 concentrations.},

abstract = {We know little about how market reform affects political development, especially citizens' behavior. Market reform advocates prescribe that citizens should reduce their reliance on the state, turn to nonstate actors for assistance, and obtain limited state goods and services through their membership in certain social categories, not their particular traits. An analysis of three mass surveys and 232 interviews the author conducted in Central Asia, along with additional data from 24 postcommunist countries, reveals that market reform can have effects opposite from those prescribed: Individuals may make particularistic demands of government officials instead of relying on nonstate actors. This occurs in countries where state economic intervention was substantial and where reforms reduced the state's economic role but failed to develop market-enhancing institutions. Under these conditions individuals informally seek resources from state officials because nonstate actors do not offer substitute resources, and market reform policies discourage reliance on the state.},

abstract = {We discuss a method for improving causal inferences called ‘‘Coarsened Exact Matching'' (CEM), and the new ‘‘Monotonic Imbalance Bounding'' (MIB) class of matching methods from which CEM is derived. We summarize what is known about CEM and MIB, derive and illustrate several new desirable statistical properties of CEM, and then propose a variety of useful extensions. We show that CEM possesses a wide range of statistical properties not available in most other matching methods but is at the same time exceptionally easy to comprehend and use. We focus on the connection between theoretical properties and practical applications. We also make available easy-to-use open source software for R, Stata, and SPSS that implement all our suggestions},

abstract = {Delivery of public goods varies significantly across the Indian states.This article argues that dif- ferences in state government expenditures are largely the result of differences in their party sys- tems. Using macroeconomic data from 1967 to 1997 as well as postelection voter surveys, we demonstrate that states with two-party competition provide more public goods than states with multiparty competition, which, we argue, reflects differing mobilization strategies. In two-party systems, political parties require support from many social groups and therefore provide public goodsto win elections. In multiparty systems, needing only a plurality of votes to win, parties use club, rather than public, goods to mobilize smaller segments of the population. In stressing the impact of party systems on state government performancein India, this article differs from recent political economy research, which has stressed either the effect of particular political parties or ethnic divisions on government performance and public goods delivery.

abstract = {In many education and social intervention programs it is thought efficacious and ethical to offer a treatment to individuals based on a measure such as need or worthiness. This entails assigning subjects to the treatment group if they are at or above some cutoff score on the measure. The outcome of the treatment is then analyzed using the regression discontinuity design technique assuming that the treatment effect can be detected at the assignment cutoff through regression analysis. In this study the power of such a design is analyzed to determine the sample size necessary for implementing the parametric regression model under some common assumptions. Violations of those assumptions threaten the validity of the RDD study. Ways to address such violations are also discussed.},

abstract = {We know little about how market reform affects political development, especially citizens' behavior. Market reform advocates prescribe that citizens should reduce their reliance on the state, turn to nonstate actors for assistance, and obtain limited state goods and services through their membership in certain social categories, not their particular traits. An analysis of three mass surveys and 232 interviews the author conducted in Central Asia, along with additional data from 24 postcommunist countries, reveals that market reform can have effects opposite from those prescribed: Individuals may make particularistic demands of government officials instead of relying on nonstate actors. This occurs in countries where state economic intervention was substantial and where reforms reduced the state's economic role but failed to develop market-enhancing institutions. Under these conditions individuals informally seek resources from state officials because nonstate actors do not offer substitute resources, and market reform policies discourage reliance on the state.},

abstract = {This important volume brings together eleven of the papers prepared for the workshop by The Expert Group on Development Issues, EGDI, at the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, in April 2006. The workshop's aim was to encourage an informative debate on how to ensure better service delivery to the poor, and how democratic processes can contribute to that end. The theme and content was deliberately formulated in broad terms. Rather than focusing on a particular aspect of improving services (like strengthening ‘voice'), or a particular service (like health), the organisers wanted the discussions to cover a range of issues and provide several perspectives on those issues. Participants represented different disciplines, approaches and opinions. The common understanding was that a strategy for improving basic services to the poor requires more than a technical management approach. The political conditions and dynamics must be considered for understanding current problems, and identifying remedies to them.},

In this review, dense monolayers of simple lipids are described in detail, including structures revealed by x-ray-diffraction experiments, computer simulations, molecular models, and a phenomenological theory of phase transitions. The effects of chirality and the structures of phospholipid monolayers are considered. Open questions and possible approaches to finding answers are discussed.},

abstract = {Countries vary systematically with respect to the incentives of politicians to provide broad public goods and to reduce poverty. Even in developing countries that are democracies, politicians often have incentives to divert resources to political rents and to private transfers that benefit a few citizens at the expense of many. These distortions can be traced to imperfections in political markets that are greater in some countries than in others. We review the theory and evidence on the impact of incomplete information of voters, the lack of credibility of political promises, and social polarization, on political incentives. We argue that the effects of these imperfections are large but insufficiently integrated into the design of policy reforms aimed at improving public good provision and reducing poverty.},

abstract = {Direct reciprocity and conditional cooperation are important mechanisms to prevent free riding in social dilemmas. However, in large groups, these mechanisms may become ineffective because they require single individuals to have a substantial influence on their peers. However, the recent discovery of zero-determinant strategies in the iterated prisoner's dilemma suggests that we may have underestimated the degree of control that a single player can exert. Here, we develop a theory for zero-determinant strategies for iterated multiplayer social dilemmas, with any number of involved players. We distinguish several particularly interesting subclasses of strategies: fair strategies ensure that the own payoff matches the average payoff of the group; extortionate strategies allow a player to perform above average; and generous strategies let a player perform below average. We use this theory to describe strategies that sustain cooperation, including generalized variants of Tit-for-Tat and Win-Stay Lose-Shift. Moreover, we explore two models that show how individuals can further enhance their strategic options by coordinating their play with others. Our results highlight the importance of individual control and coordination to succeed in large groups.},

@article{Schofield2013,
abstract = {Many of the world's poor consume very few calories; one-seventh of the world's population remains below recommended intake levels. Yet, the impact of this nominally low caloric intake on productivity is unclear. This paper presents two analyses which find that changes in caloric intake result in substantial and broadly generalizable changes in productivity among malnourished adults in India. The first draws on a five-week randomized controlled trial among cycle-rickshaw drivers in Chennai, in which half of the participants received an additional 700 calories per day. Treated individuals showed significant improvements in both physical and cognitive tasks and increased labor supply and income by approximately 10 percent by the final week. The second study examines the impact of a 700 calorie per day decline in intake, caused by fasting during Ramadan, on agricultural production. This analysis leverages heterogeneity in cropping cycles between and within districts as well as the fact that Ramadan cycles throughout the calendar year to generate three sources of variation in the overlap between fasting and the labor intensive portions of the cropping cycle. Using a triple-difference approach, I find that overlap between Ramadan and the labor intensive portions of cropping cycles results in declines in production which correspond to a 20 to 40 percent decrease in productivity per fasting individual. Multiple sources of evidence suggest that production declines are driven primarily by reduced caloric intake rather than by other behavioral changes during Ramadan. The estimated return to investment in additional calories is positive, with point estimates of 65 percent over six months in the randomized trial and 225 percent over one month during Ramadan fasting. Given substantial evidence that traditionally hypothesized liquidity constraints do not meaningfully limit caloric consumption, the low caloric intake of the majority of Indian adults presents a puzzle in light of the high estimated returns. Responses from an incentivized survey suggest that inaccurate beliefs about both the returns to calories and the caloric content of foods may play a role in the low levels of caloric consumption.},

abstract = {Brazil's democratic constitution granted municipalities responsibility to design and implement social policies, allowing for tailored programs to meet local constituent demands. Yet instead of pursuing local diversity, many governments chose to emulate programs made famous elsewhere. What explains the diffusion of social programs across Brazil? This article investigates whether policy makers are motivated by political self-interest, ideology, or socialized norms. It draws on an event history analysis of two innovative programs that have diffused throughout Brazil's largest cities: Bolsa Escola, an education program, and Programa Sa{\'{u}}de da Fam{\'{i}}lia, a family health program. The author argues that political incentives, such as electoral competition, cannot explain diffusion. Rather, diffusion occurs when left-of-center mayors are ideologically compelled to enact these programs and when public officials with connections to professional networks are socialized to follow professional norms.},

abstract = {Most election fraud is not conducted centrally by incumbents but rather locally by a multitude of political operatives. How does an incumbent ensure that his agents de- liver fraud when needed and as much as is needed? We address this and related puzzles in the political organization of election fraud by studying the perverse consequences of incentive conflicts between incumbents and their local agents. These incentive con- flicts result in a herd dynamic among the agents that tends to either oversupply or undersupply fraud, rarely delivering the amount of fraud that would be optimal from the incumbent's point of view. Our analysis of the political organization of election fraud explains why fraud sometimes fails to deliver victories, why popular incumbents often preside over seemingly unnecessary fraud, and it predicts that the extent of fraud should be increasing in both the incumbent's genuine support and reported results across precincts. A statistical analysis of anomalies in precinct-level results from the 2011-12 Russian legislative and presidential elections supports our key claims.},

This unique equilibrium depends not only on the fundamentals, but also on financial variables, such as the quantity of hot money in circulation and the costs of speculative trading. In contrast to multiple equilibrium models, our model allows analysis ofpolicy proposals directed at curtailing currency attacks.},

abstract = {We examine the effects of moving out of high-poverty neighborhoods on the outcomes of teenage youth, a population often seen as most at risk from the adverse effects of such neighborhoods. The randomized design of the Moving To Opportunity demonstration allows us to compare groups of youth, initially similar and living in high-poverty public housing. An “experimental” group was offered vouchers valid only in a low-poverty neighborhood; a “Section 8” group was offered traditional vouchers without geographic restriction; and a control group was not offered vouchers. We study outcomes in four domains: education, risky behavior, mental health, and physical health. Females in the experimental group experienced improvements in education and mental health and were less likely to engage in risky behaviors. Females in the traditional voucher group experienced improvements in mental health. Males in both treatment groups were more likely than controls to engage in risky behaviors and to experience physical health problems. We adopt a multiple-testing framework to account for the large number of estimates considered. We show that the overall effects on females in the experimental group and the effects on mental health for females in both treatment groups were least likely to be due to sampling variation. Families with female children and families with male children moved to similar neighborhoods, suggesting that their outcomes differ not because of exposure to different types of neighborhoods but because male and female youth respond to their environments in different ways.},

This result is robust to several specifications and evident in a natural experiment consisting of New Jersey residents.

abstract = {This paper offers a first comprehensive account of popular voting intentions in Africa's new electoral democracies. With reference to aggregate and survey data from 16 countries, this paper shows that competitive elections in Africa are more than mere ethnic censuses or simple economic referenda. Instead, Africans engage in bothethnic andeconomic voting. Not surprisingly, people who belong to the ethnic group in power intend to support the ruling party, in contrast to those who feel a sense of discrimination against their cultural group. But, to an even greater extent, would-be voters in Africa consider policy performance, especially the government's perceived handling of unemployment, inflation, and income distribution. Moreover, a full account of the intended vote choice in Africa also requires recognition that citizens are motivated – sincerely or strategically – by partisan considerations; they vote for established ruling parties because they expect that incumbents will win. This paper shows that voters attempt to associate themselves with prospective winners because they wish to gain access to material benefits and to avoid retribution after the election. These dynamics are most evident in African countries where dominant parties restrict the range of electoral choice.},

abstract = {Language is a remarkably efficient tool for transmitting information. Yet human speakers make statements that are inefficient, imprecise, or even contrary to their own beliefs, all in the service of being polite. What rational machinery underlies polite language use? Here, we show that polite speech emerges from the competition of three communicative goals: to convey information, to be kind, and to present oneself in a good light. We formalize this goal tradeoff using a prob-abilistic model of utterance production, which predicts human utterance choices in socially-sensitive situations with high quantitative accuracy, and we show that our full model is superior to its variants with subsets of the three goals. This utility-theoretic approach to speech acts takes a step towards explaining the richness and subtlety of social language use.},

@article{Mangal2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The completion of poliomyelitis eradication is a global emergency for public health. In 2012, more than 50{\%} of the world's cases occurred in Nigeria following an unanticipated surge in incidence. We aimed to quantitatively analyse the key factors sustaining transmission of poliomyelitis in Nigeria and to calculate clinical efficacy estimates for the oral poliovirus vaccines (OPV) currently in use.

METHODS: We used acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance data from Nigeria collected between January, 2001, and December, 2012, to estimate the clinical efficacies of all four OPVs in use and combined this with vaccination coverage to estimate the effect of the introduction of monovalent and bivalent OPV on vaccine-induced serotype-specific population immunity. Vaccine efficacy was determined using a case-control study with CIs based on bootstrap resampling. Vaccine efficacy was also estimated separately for north and south Nigeria, by age of the children, and by year. Detailed 60-day follow-up data were collected from children with confirmed poliomyelitis and were used to assess correlates of vaccine status. We also quantitatively assessed the epidemiology of poliomyelitis and programme performance and considered the reasons for the high vaccine refusal rate along with risk factors for a given local government area reporting a case.

FINDINGS: Against serotype 1, both monovalent OPV (median 32.1{\%}, 95{\%} CI 26.1-38.1) and bivalent OPV (29.5{\%}, 20.1-38.4) had higher clinical efficacy than trivalent OPV (19.4{\%}, 16.1-22.8). Corresponding data for serotype 3 were 43.2{\%} (23.1-61.1) and 23.8{\%} (5.3-44.9) compared with 18.0{\%} (14.1-22.1). Combined with increases in coverage, this factor has boosted population immunity in children younger than age 36 months to a record high (64-69{\%} against serotypes 1 and 3). Vaccine efficacy in northern states was estimated to be significantly lower than in southern states (p≤0.05). The proportion of cases refusing vaccination decreased from 37-72{\%} in 2008 to 21-51{\%} in 2012 for routine and supplementary immunisation, and most caregivers cited ignorance of either vaccine importance or availability as the main reason for missing routine vaccinations (32.1{\%} and 29.6{\%} of cases, respectively). Multiple regression analyses highlighted associations between the age of the mother, availability of OPV at health facilities, and the primary source of health information and the probability of receiving OPV (all p{\textless}0.05).

INTERPRETATION: Although high refusal rates, low OPV campaign awareness, and heterogeneous population immunity continued to support poliomyelitis transmission in Nigeria at the end of 2012, overall population immunity had improved due to new OPV formulations and improvements in programme delivery.

abstract = {Selection bias is an important but often neglected problem in comparative research. While comparative case studies pay some attention to this problem, this is less the case in broader cross-national studies, where this problem may appear through the way the data used are generated. The article discusses three examples: studies of the success of newly formed political parties, research on protest events, and recent work on ethnic conflict. In all cases the data at hand are likely to be afflicted by selection bias. Failing to take into consideration this problem leads to serious biases in the estimation of simple relationships. Empirical examples illustrate a possible solution (a variation of a Tobit model) to the problems in these cases. The article also discusses results of Monte Carlo simulations, illustrating under what conditions the proposed estimation procedures lead to improved results.},

While YSR instituted many schemes to address the needs of the poor, this largesse was also designed to feed a network of supporters. YSR's rule marked a clear departure from the time-honoured "politics of accommodation" in the Congress: perhaps for the first time, a uniquely parochial Reddy regime was put in place throughout the state. Turning the new approach of the Congress in New Delhi to his advantage, YSR managed to marginalise opposition to his leadership and thus emerged as the most powerful Congress chief minister of Andhra Pradesh in recent times.},

abstract = {Transfer and redistribution of wealth accompany most violent conflicts throughout the world, yet the local-level political and economic effects of this phenomenon remain unexplored. We address this omission by examining the long-term impact on the surrounding communities of the Nazi death camp Treblinka in Poland, where nearly a million Jews were murdered. The assets of murdered Jews sometimes ended up in the hands of the local population. We are able to identify the enduring impact of these property transfers on local economic and political outcomes because the exact location of Treblinka was exogenous to the characteristics of surrounding communities. We find that communities located closer to the camp experienced a real estate boom but do not exhibit higher levels of economic and social development. These communities also showed higher support for an anti-Semitic party, the League of Polish Families. Our findings speak to an important but overlooked challenge to post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation.},

abstract = {Researchers need to select high-quality research designs and communicate those designs clearly to readers. Both tasks are difficult. We provide a framework for formally "declaring" the analytically relevant features of a research design in a demonstrably complete manner, with applications to qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research. The approach to design declaration we describe requires defining a model of the world (M), an inquiry (I), a data strategy (D), and an answer strategy (A). Declaration of these features in code provides sufficient information for researchers and readers to use Monte Carlo techniques to diagnose properties such as power, bias, accuracy of qualitative causal inferences, and other "diag-nosands." Ex ante declarations can be used to improve designs and facilitate preregistration, analysis, and reconciliation of intended and actual analyses. Ex post declarations are useful for describing, sharing, reanalyzing, and critiquing existing designs. We provide open-source software, DeclareDesign, to implement the proposed approach. for their many contributions to the broader project. The methods proposed in this paper are implemented in an accompanying open-source software package, DeclareDesign (Blair et al. 2018).},

This paper presents a model in which government resources can be used 'productivity', for the benefit of everybody, or 'unproductively', for the benefit of the ruling party's constituency. A government more inclined to unproductive spending may choose to collect public resources inefficiently in order to produce the importance of spending decisions in the election. The model highlights the strategic role of policy decisions that affect incentives and constraints faced by future governments, and their impact on election results. ?? 1994.},

Studies of clientelism should distinguish between substantively different patterns of machine politics. A fundamental but often overlooked distinction lies between “electoral clientelism” and what I term “relational clientelism.” Electoral clientelism delivers all payoffs to citizens before voting, and involves the threat of opportunistic defection by citizens. By contrast, relational clientelism continues to deliver benefits to citizens after voting, and involves the threat of opportunistic defection by both citizens and politicians. Building on fieldwork and regression analysis, this study explores these distinct patterns of clientelism in the context of healthcare and female sterilization in Brazil.},

We model a “calculus of protest” of individuals who must either submit to the status quo or support revolt based only on personal information about their payoffs. In deciding whether to revolt, the citizen must infer both the benefit of successful revolution and the likely actions of other citizens. We characterize conditions under which payoff uncertainty overturns conventional wisdom: (a) when a citizen is too willing to revolt, he reduces the incentives of others to revolt; (b) less accurate information about the value of revolution can make revolt more likely; (c) public signals from other citizens can reduce the likelihood of revolt; (d) harsher punishment can increase the incidence of punishment; and (e) the incidence of protest can be positively correlated with that of repression.},

abstract = {Existing evidence suggests that extra grant revenues lead to little improvements in public services in developing countries - but would governments spend tax revenues differently? This paper considers a program that invests in the tax capacity of Brazilian municipalities. Using variations in the timing of program uptake I find that it raises local tax revenues and that the increase in taxes is used to improve both the quantity and quality of municipal education infrastructure. In contrast increases in grants over which municipalities have the same discretion as over taxes have no impact on any measure of local public infrastructure.},

abstract = {Andhra Pradesh is a relatively underdeveloped state in south India that has become one of the leaders of the Indian reform process. How was this possible? With the help of 12 hypotheses, the paper discusses the politics of the reforms in Andhra Pradesh. The focus is particularly on the period between 1995 and 2004, during which an explicitly reform-oriented government ruled the state. The paper suggests that an important factor behind the reforms seems to lie in the changing economic needs and aspirations of the initially rural-based classes/groups on which the reforming regime was based. Moreover, in contrast to some other Indian states, reforms in Andhra Pradesh were not introduced by stealth, but by hype, by a skilful and cleverly managing leadership that succeeded in suggesting a break with the past while it continued with pro-poor spending and continued to allow policy implementation to be (mis)used for local-level party building.

@book{Olson1965a,
abstract = {This book develops an original theory of group and organizational behavior that cuts across disciplinary lines and illustrates the theory with empirical and historical studies of particular organizations. Applying economic analysis to the subjects of the political scientist, sociologist, and economist, Mr. Olson examines the extent to which the individuals that share a common interest find it in their individual interest to bear the costs of the organizational effort. The theory shows that most organizations produce what the economist calls "public goods"--goods or services that are available to every member, whether or not he has borne any of the costs of providing them. Economists have long understood that defense, law and order were public goods that could not be marketed to individuals, and that taxation was necessary. They have not, however, taken account of the fact that private as well as governmental organizations produce public goods. The services the labor union provides for the worker it represents, or the benefits a lobby obtains for the group it represents, are public goods: they automatically go to every individual in the group, whether or not he helped bear the costs. It follows that, just as governments require compulsory taxation, many large private organizations require special (and sometimes coercive) devices to obtain the resources they need. This is not true of smaller organizations for, as this book shows, small and large organizations support themselves in entirely different ways. The theory indicates that, though small groups can act to further their interest much more easily than large ones, they will tend to devote too few resources to the satisfaction of their common interests, and that there is a surprising tendency for the "lesser" members of the small group to exploit the "greater" members by making them bear a disproportionate share of the burden of any group action. All of the theory in the book is in Chapter 1; the remaining chapters contain empirical and historical evidence of the theory's relevance to labor unions, pressure groups, corporations, and Marxian class action.},

abstract = {As communist regimes collapsed in the years 1989—91, communist parties and leaders exited power in roughly half the cases. The causes and the impact of this variation have generated considerable controversy. The authors show that the combined timing and content of the introduction of mass literacy was responsible for generating the national standards and comparisons that either sustained the legitimacy of communist party rule or led to its rapid and complete demise during the collapse of communist regimes. Mass literacy explains more of the patterns of the communist exit than do structural, modernization, or communist legacy accounts, and it provides a clear and sustained causal chain.},

abstract = {The article explores the connection between democratisation, decentral- isation and sub-national policy making. It seeks to explain variation in the policy choices that were made by Brazilian state governments in the defi nition of school governance structures following the return to demo- cracy. Whereas some state governments decided to institute the election of school principals by parents, students and teachers, others decided on the maintenance of opaque and discretionary practices that secured the distribution of school posts according to political criteria. The research relies on primary comparative evidence from three states: Bahia, Cear{\'{a}} and Minas Gerais. The argument is that the institutional choices made by state governments depended on the structure of political competition and on the extent and intensity of elite divisions at the state level.},

This article analyzes an original data set on the bureaucratic features and its effects on corruption in fifty-two countries. Two empirical findings challenge the conventional wisdom in literature. First, certain bureaucratic factors, particularly meritocratic recruitment, reduce corruption, even when controlling for a large set of alternative explanations. Second, the analysis shows that other allegedly relevant bureaucratic factors, such as public employees' competitive salaries, career stability, or internal promotion, do not have a significant impact.},

abstract = {Supporting effective public sector reform is a major challenge that the World Bank and other agencies and stakeholders have been grappling with. It is increasingly recognized that political economy factors play a crucial role. However, beyond this broad proposition, specific questions arise: What country contexts are more/less propitious for public sector reforms and what reforms are likely to succeed where? And can more explicitly taking political economy challenges into account help to pursue public sector reforms even in less propitious contexts? This paper addresses these issues in two ways: first, it draws on the existing literature to identify key propositions about factors that can trigger or facilitate public sector reforms, and those that tend to work against (successful) reforms. Second, it investigates the experience of World Bank public sector operations over the decade 2000-2010. It finds that governments in many developing countries face incentives to initiate public sector reforms, but that at the implementation stage, political costs frequently outweigh potential gains; and hence reforms are abandoned or left to wither. Real breakthroughs have been achieved in countries experiencing major structural shifts and those having political leadership committed to higher-level goals. The review of operations shows that successful projects are significantly more widespread than the literature would lead to assume. Furthermore, it provides tentative evidence that investing in understanding political economy drivers has been associated with better project performance. Key implications are the need to differentiate between country contexts more clearly ex ante, concentrate more on reform implementation during windows of opportunity that are typically of limited duration, and design reforms with a clear plan of engagement with stakeholder incentives.},

abstract = {Political scientists often turn to natural experiments to draw causal inferences with observational data. Recently, the regression discontinuity design (RD) has become a popular type of natural experiment due to its relatively weak assumptions. We study a special type of regression discontinuity design where the discontinuity in treatment assignment is geographic. In this design, which we call the Geographic Regression Discontinuity (GRD) design, a geographic or administrative boundary splits units into treated and control areas, and analysts make the case that the division into treated and control areas occurs in an as-if random fashion. We show how this design is equivalent to a standard RD with two running variables, but we also clarify several methodological differences that arise in geographical contexts. We also offer a method for estimation of geographically located treatment effects that can also be used to validate the identification assumptions using observable pretreatment characteristics. We illustrate our methodological framework with a re-examination of the effects of political advertisements on voter turnout during a presidential campaign, exploiting the exogenous variation in the volume of presidential ads that is created by media market boundaries.},

abstract = {The expansion and politicization of the postcommunist state, even among the reform leaders of Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, has confounded early expectations that the state would shrink and grow autonomous once the communist regime collapsed. The variation in these patterns is a function of the distribution of party power in parliament, both over time (turnover) and among parties (fragmentation and effective opposition). Where several strong opposing parties competed for governance, the resulting electoral uncertainty led them to constrain each other through formal regulations and informal practices. In contrast, where one party dominated political competition, lax (or nonexistent) regulations allowed the informal extraction of resources from state firms, the procurement of favorable privatization deals, and the accumulation of positions in public administration. This explanation contrasts with existing accounts, which emphasize either broad communist regime legacies or the functional need for state growth in newly independent states.},

abstract = {There is currently much debate about the effectiveness of foreign aid and about what kind of projects can engender economic development. There is skepticism about the ability of econometric analysis to resolve these issues or of development agencies to learn from their own experience. In response, there is increasing use in development economics of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to accumulate credible knowledge of what works, without overreliance on questionable theory or statistical methods. When RCTs are not possible, the proponents of these methods advocate quasi- randomization through instrumental variable (IV) techniques or natural experiments. I argue that many of these applications are unlikely to recover quantities that are useful for policy or understanding: two key issues are the misunderstanding of exogeneity and the handling of heterogeneity. I illustrate from the literature on aid and growth. Actual randomization faces similar problems as does quasi-randomization, notwithstanding rhetoric to the contrary. I argue that experiments have no special ability to produce more credible knowledge than other methods, and that actual experiments are frequently subject to practical problems that undermine any claims to statistical or epistemic superiority. I illustrate using prominent experiments in development and elsewhere. As with IV methods, RCT-based evaluation of projects, without guidance from an understanding of underlying mechanisms, is unlikely to lead to scientific progress in the understanding of economic development. I welcome recent trends in development experimentation away from the evaluation of projects and toward the evaluation of theoretical mechanisms. (JEL C21, F35, O19)},

abstract = {Can formal democratic institutions succeed if they are built in societies with inhospitable social and economic conditions? In particular, will attempts to hold competitive elections fail to strengthen democracy in poor and divided nation states, as well as in regions such as the Middle East which are dominated by autocracy? Skeptics point to an earlier wave of institution building, when European-style parliaments were transplanted to many African societies during the era of decolonization, including in Benin and Togo, only to collapse as the military usurped their powers.1 We first need to establish the influence of certain underlying economic and social conditions on democratic consolidation before proceeding to examine the impact of power- sharing institutions in subsequent chapters. As Dahl points out, where the underlying conditions are highly unfavorable, then it is improbable that democracy could be preserved by any constitutional design. By contrast, if the underlying conditions are highly favorable, then democratic consolidation is likely with almost any constitution.2 But many cases fall into the muddy middle-ground. The analysis of cross-sectional time-series data illuminates the general patterns and what conditions count, focusing upon examining the role of wealth, the size of nation states, colonial legacies, regional diffusion, and the degree of ethnic heterogeneity. Each of these factors can be regarded as ‘structural' constraints on political development, meaning that it is difficult for domestic policymakers or the international community to alter these conditions in the medium to short-term, if at all; for example countries cannot change their histories or chose their neighboring states, although they can attempt to grow their economy. The East Asian cases of South Korea and Singapore provide further insights into how certain structural factors facilitate, but do not determine, democratic consolidation. Both Asian societies have experienced rapidly economic transformation in recent decades, yet South Korea has adopted multiparty elections and strengthened human rights, with the regimes rated by Freedom House as equivalent to Greece or Israel, while Singapore is rated only ‘partly free' by Freedom House. The contrasts help to explain the strengths – and limits – of socioeconomic explanations of democratization.},

Since in general the number of stationary equilibria is overwhelming, we pay attention to the issue of equilibrium selection.

As a by-product of our results, we extend a recent result on the generic finiteness of stationary equilibria in stochastic games to oddness of equilibria. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Andhra Pradesh is a relatively underdeveloped state in south India that has become one of the leaders of the Indian reform process. How was this possible? With the help of 12 hypotheses, the paper discusses the politics of the reforms in Andhra Pradesh. The focus is particularly on the period between 1995 and 2004, during which an explicitly reform-oriented government ruled the state. The paper suggests that an important factor behind the reforms seems to lie in the changing economic needs and aspirations of the initially rural-based classes/groups on which the reforming regime was based. Moreover, in contrast to some other Indian states, reforms in Andhra Pradesh were not introduced by stealth, but by hype, by a skilful and cleverly managing leadership that succeeded in suggesting a break with the past while it continued with pro-poor spending and continued to allow policy implementation to be (mis)used for local-level party building.

abstract = {In Harsanyi and Selten's equilibrium selection theory, the linear tracing procedure has been used to model the hypothetical reasoning process of expectation formation. This paper reconsiders the linear tracing procedure from the perspective of the relationship between priors and Nash equilibria. A prior belongs to the source set of a Nash equilibrium if the linear tracing procedure based on this prior leads to that equilibrium. We show that for any Nash equilibrium, its source set is always nonempty and closed, but not generally convex. This paper also constructs an approach of iterative application of the linear tracing procedure to the auxiliary games that are used to model the hypothetical reasoning under the procedure. We present a notion of robustness of Nash equilibria based on this idea, by replacing uncertainty modelled by a single probability measure with uncertainty modelled by sets of probability measures. This approach attempts to capture the fact that players may not be sufficiently confident in the available information in order to single out one probability distribution that represents their initial beliefs about the other players' possible strategy choices.},

abstract = {This article provides a new comparative methodology for the study of party–voter linkages from the perspective of voters, where the critical question that distinguishes clientelistic from programmatic parties is access to publicly provided benefits. In the former case, partisan networks mediate access to goods. In the latter, beneficiaries are defined by policy and access is independent from partisan distribution networks. We show that these different access mechanisms shape voters' distributive expectations and the nature of their linkages to political parties by developing a unique methodology to measure party networks. We test it using original survey data from Argentina and Chile and show variation both across and within countries on party–voter linkages based on differential access to benefits and parties' organizational capacity.},

abstract = {Despite repeated calls for the use of “mixed methods” in comparative analysis, political scientists have few systematic guides for carrying out such work. This paper details a unified approach which joins intensive case-study analysis with statistical analysis. Not only are the advantages of each approach combined, but also there is a synergistic value to the nested research design: for example, statistical analyses can guide case selection for in-depth research, provide direction for more focused case studies and comparisons, and be used to provide additional tests of hypotheses generated from small-N research. Small-N analyses can be used to assess the plausibility of observed statistical relationships between variables, to generate theoretical insights from outlier and other cases, and to develop better measurement strategies. This integrated strategy improves the prospects of making valid causal inferences in cross-national and other forms of comparative research by drawing on the distinct strengths of two important approaches.},

Originally developed for marketing research, political scientists have recently applied this method to understand how citizens evaluate policies (Horiuchi, Smith and Yamamoto, 2015), candidates (Carlson, 2015; Rosenzweig and Tsai, N.d.) and immigrants (Hainmueller, Hopkins and Yamamoto, 2014; Berinsky et al., 2015). With its growing popularity, conjoint analysis is increasingly being employed across a variety of contexts and respondent samples. Researchers are now applying this method to study attitudes and behaviors in developing countries. However, these contexts pose problems for existing tools and implementation practices. We developed tools to overcome these obstacles that can be used to implement the conjoint method in contexts where surveys are conducted offline and with illiterate respondents.},

abstract = {The conditional cash transfer (CCT) programme Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia (Family Allowance), introduced in Brazil in 2003, is one of the largest such programmes in the world. Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia has played a role in the recent reduction of poverty and income inequality in Brazil. But what has been its impact on democracy? An assumption in the literature on social policy, derived from the European experience, is that targeted programmes such as Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia divide citizens, erode trust between citizens and between citizens and the state, and weaken democracy. This article challenges that assumption, showing that there is considerable evidence that Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia has strengthened the citizenship rights of the poor and enhanced democracy. The Brazilian experience suggests that, in highly unequal developing countries under conditions of 21st-century capitalism, the argument that targeted social programmes will inevitably undermine democracy is incorrect.},

abstract = {The strong support that African presidents retain among voters of their own ethnicity, despite clear evidence of shirking and corruption, has prompted numerous empirical investigations into whether an incumbent's ethnicity or performance is more important to African voters. The model of vote choice underlying almost all of these studies is additive and implies that either coethnicity or good performance can increase a candidate's vote share. However, there is little theoretical justification for such a model. In the dominant theory of ethnic voting in Africa, coethnicity is a signal of better outcomes, indicating that ethnicity and performance are not separate considerations. Using an experiment that is designed to determine how Ugandan voters make choices, the author shows that the effects of coethnicity and good performance interact: neither attribute increases support for a candidate in the absence of the other. Though previous analyses indicate that, all else being equal, voters always prefer coethnics, this study demonstrates that coethnics only have an advantage when they are not shirkers. Additionally, though previous studies indicate that voters always prefer good performers, this analysis shows that voters are indifferent to the performance of non-coethnic candidates. The article provides evidence that this pattern is in fact a result of voters' beliefs that they will only receive future goods from coethnics, making a demonstrated ability to provide such goods relevant for the electability of coethnic candidates, but not for non-coethnics. Since a large number of African voters do not share the ethnicity of their incumbent, this finding has troubling implications for accountability of African leaders.},

abstract = {Adequate targeting is a primary concern in the design of any social programme that attempts to reach a specific group in society. This paper studies the targeting of a healthcare-centre programme aimed at the poor that relies on household self-selection into the programme at the local level. We find that a key variable in determining utilisation of the health centres is location. Households living near a centre are substantially more likely to use it than households living further away. This points to the importance of facility placement in targeting self-selected health programmes to the poor. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {As countries throughout the world democratize and decentralize, citizen participation in public life should increase. In this paper, I suggest that democratic participation in local government is enhanced when citizens can reply affirmatively to at least three questions about their ability to hold local officials accountable for their actions: Can citizens use the vote effectively to reward and punish the general or specific performance of local public officials and/or the parties they represent? Can citizens generate response to their collective needs from local governments? Can citizens be ensured of fair and equitable treatment from public agencies at local levels? The findings of a study of 30 randomly selected municipalities in Mexico indicate that, over the course of a decade and a half, voters were able to enforce alternation in power and the circulation of elites, but not necessarily to transmit unambiguous messages to public officials or parties about performance concerns. More definitively, citizens were able to build successfully on prior political experiences to extract benefits from local governments. At the same time, the ability to demand good performance of local government as a right of citizenship lagged behind other forms of accountability.},

This study aimed to translate the original English version of the Questionnaire to Chinese and to provide psychometric evidence on the validity and reliability of the translated version. DESIGN. Cross-sectional study. SETTING. Out-patient clinic of a non-teaching hospital in Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS. The Paediatric Allergic Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire was translated to Chinese and then completed by a group of 115 Hong Kong Chinese children (66 male and 49 female; mean age, 11 years) with allergic disease(s). All subjects were asked to respond using visual analogue scales dealing with issues related to the perceived morbidity of allergic diseases. To assess test-retest reliability, 2 weeks later a subgroup of 16 individuals was retested with the same Questionnaire. RESULTS. The internal consistency of the Chinese Paediatric Allergic Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire was satisfactory (Cronbach alpha=0.92). The correlation between the total Questionnaire score and the visual analogue scale score was moderately significant (Spearman's rho=0.49; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.34-0.62). Structural validity as studied by confirmatory factor analysis found that the structure of subscales was remarkably similar to the original English version. The intra-class correlation between the Questionnaire score from the first and the second test in the subgroup of 16 subjects was 0.75, indicating adequate repeatability. CONCLUSION. The validity and reliability of the Chinese version of the Paediatric Allergic Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire was established for clinical use.},

In the past ten years, political scientists have realized that GIS can help them address many research questions and data analysis tasks quite apart from these traditional applications. These include the analysis of point patterns and the detection of clustering; the study of diffusion of influence; and the measurement of spatial relationships involving key constructs such as proximity and distance, flow, and interaction. GIS tools also prove to be the exploratory complements to the suite of tools being used in spatial econometrics to test explicit hypotheses about the impact of geography and spatial arrangement on political outcomes.},

abstract = {Countries vary systematically with respect to the incentives of politicians to provide broad public goods and to reduce poverty. Even in developing countries that are democracies, politicians often have incentives to divert resources to political rents and to private transfers that benefit a few citizens at the expense of many. These distortions can be traced to imperfections in political markets that are greater in some countries than in others. We review the theory and evidence on the impact of incomplete information of voters, the lack of credibility of political promises, and social polarization, on political incentives. We argue that the effects of these imperfections are large but insufficiently integrated into the design of policy reforms aimed at improving public good provision and reducing poverty.},

abstract = {I analyze a class of repeated signaling games in which the informed player's type is persistent and the history of actions is perfectly observable. In this context, a large class of possibly complex sequences of signals can be supported as the separating equilibrium actions of the "strong type" of the informed player. I characterize the set of such sequences. I also characterize the sequences of signals in least cost separating equilibria (LCSE) of these games. In doing this, I introduce a state variable that can be interpreted as a measure of reputation. This gives the optimization problem characterizing the LCSE a recursive structure. I show that, in general, the equilibrium path sequences of signals have a simple structure. The shapes of the optimal sequences depend critically on the relative concavities of the payoff functions of different types, which measure the relative preferences towards payoff smoothing. {\textcopyright}2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Political principals face high-powered electoral pressures while bureaucrat-agents face longer term, low-powered incentives. Given constitutional constraints, what "carrots and sticks" do politicians employ to control bureaucrats and how do bureaucrats respond to such incentives? We use a simple career concerns framework and a unique dataset from the Indian Administrative Service to address these issues. State level politicians (Chief Ministers) exert control over bureaucrats when they assume office, through a novel mechanism of reassignment (transfers) to new jobs. Transfers are less likely if district politicians belong to the same party as the Chief Minister, i.e. he appears to treat local politicians and bureaucrats as substitutes. We use a framework where bureaucrats differ in their willingness to invest in job expertise or political loyalty. Consistent with this framework, we find in our data that more able bureaucrats and those with greater job-specific experience are less likely to be reassigned when a new politician assumes office. In accordance with politicians district reassignment patterns, we do not find robust evidence of any negative impact of such politically-induced transfers on development and policy outcomes at the district level.},

It captures the shift from a welfare state based on corporatist principles to one that comes closer to basic universalism. Whereas Vargas's incorpora- tion project addressed workers as producers, later governments incur- porated the informal poor as beneficiaries of public policy programs – including income support policies – in a more individualist and liberal fashion. ?},

This literature review attends to three key questions about developmental states and the answers proposed to them within the literature, namely; what worked? Why did it work? And would it work elsewhere? It also examines an emerging literature suggesting other models of a developmental state more suited to contemporary circumstances, which focus more explicitly on development as a social phenomenon rather than as a purely economic one. These are of particular interest given ESIDs focus on inclusive development. The conclusions of the paper examine some of the gaps in the literature and suggest an agenda for future research which includes addressing questions around: How does the consensus of conducting developmental roles come about – and how is it sustained? Patrimonialism, personal rule, development and stability Role of education, especially higher/further education Importance of rural/agriculture policies},

abstract = {This paper combines dynamic social choice and strategic experimentation to study the following question: How does a society, a committee, or, more generally, a group of individuals with potentially heterogeneous preferences, experiment with new opportunities? Each voter recognizes that, during experimentation, other voters also learn about their preferences. As a result, pivotal voters today are biased against experimentation because it reduces their likelihood of remaining pivotal. This phenomenon reduces equilibrium experimentation below the socially efficient level, and may even result in a negative option value of experimentation. However, one can restore efficiency by designing a voting rule that depends deterministically on time. Another main result is that even when payoffs of a reform are independently distributed across the population, good news about any individual's payoff increases other individuals' incentives to experiment with that reform, due to a positive voting externality.},

Using a new dataset of assassination attempts on all world leaders from 1875 to 2004, we exploit inherent randomness in the success or failure of assassination attempts to identify the effects of assassination. We find that, on average, successful assassinations of autocrats produce sustained moves toward democracy. We also find that assassinations affect the intensity of small-scale conflicts. The results document a contemporary source of institutional change, inform theories of conflict, and show that small sources of randomness can have a pronounced effect on history.},

@article{Chandra2009,
abstract = {This article introduces a hypothesis predicting when we should see split-ticket voting in 'patronage democracies' derived from a model of strategic voting for ethnic parties. It supports the model based on an examination of the behaviour of Scheduled Caste voters in the north-Indian state of Uttar Pradesh across national and regional elections in 1996 using multiple sources of data: an EI analysis of election results, ethnography, and survey data. These data are consistent with the model, but are not conclusive. In contrast to previous scholarship on ethnic parties, which assumes that those who support ethnic parties vote sincerely, these data show that strategic voting drives the phenomenon of split-ticket voting by Scheduled Caste voters. But they do not allow us to rule out that strategic mechanisms other than those introduced here may explain the same outcome. A stronger test requires demographic and survey data tailored to distinguish precisely between different models of strategic voting, with different predictions for the conditions under which voters split their tickets. So far, the dominant assumption of sincere voting in the work on ethnic parties has meant that these data are rarely collected. The contribution of this article is to make a sufficient case that collecting such data is important to understanding ethnicity and voting behaviour in India and other patronage democracies. {\textcopyright}2008.},

abstract = {A basic feature of many field experiments is that investigators are only able to randomize clusters of individuals—such as households, com-munities, firms, medical practices, schools or classrooms—even when the individual is the unit of interest. To recoup the resulting efficiency loss, some studies pair similar clusters and randomize treatment within pairs. However, many other studies avoid pairing, in part because of claims in the litera-ture, echoed by clinical trials standards organizations, that this matched-pair, cluster-randomization design has serious problems. We argue that all such claims are unfounded. We also prove that the estimator recommended for this design in the literature is unbiased only in situations when matching is unnecessary; its standard error is also invalid. To overcome this problem without modeling assumptions, we develop a simple design-based estimator with much improved statistical properties. We also propose a model-based approach that includes some of the benefits of our design-based estimator as well as the estimator in the literature. Our methods also address individual-level noncompliance, which is common in applications but not allowed for in most existing methods. We show that from the perspective of bias, efficiency, power, robustness or research costs, and in large or small samples, pairing should be used in cluster-randomized experiments whenever feasible; failing to do so is equivalent to discarding a considerable fraction of one's data. We develop these techniques in the context of a randomized evaluation we are conducting of the Mexican Universal Health Insurance Program.},

abstract = {In experimental animal studies, tumour necrosis factor-{\$}\alpha{\$} (TNF-{\$}\alpha{\$}) contributed to renal hypertrophy during diabetes, and antibodies against TNF-{\$}\alpha{\$} have led to improved histological lesions in animals with nephrotoxicity and diabetic nephropathy. We aimed to evaluate TNF-{\$}\alpha{\$} system activity in association with renal histology in patients with type 2 diabetes. This is a prospective, cross-sectional study of 22 patients with type 2 diabetes (16 men), 13 with microalbuminuria and 9 with normoalbuminuria. Plasma-soluble TNF-{\$}\alpha{\$} receptor 1 and 2 (sTNFR1 and sTNFR2) concentrations were used as surrogates of TNF-{\$}\alpha{\$} system activity. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was analysed using I(125)-Iodothalamine. Albumin excretion rate (AER) and a renal biopsy were performed in all subjects. AER did not associate significantly with mesangial expansion or interstitial fraction in these subjects (r {\textless}0.12, P {\textgreater}0.5). AER was also not associated with either sTNFR1 or sTNFR2 levels. However, after controlling for GFR, the correlation between AER and sTNFR1 became significant (r = 0.47, P = 0.03). sTNFR1 correlated with age (r = 0.65, P {\textless}0.001), mesangial expansion (r = 0.59, P = 0.004) and interstitial fraction (r = 0.58, P = 0.005). After controlling for age, body mass index and blood pressure, the association of TNFR1 with mesangial expansion persisted significant. Circulating sTNFR2 concentrations were not significantly associated with histological changes. In summary, structural kidney damage in patients with type 2 diabetes is associated with TNF-{\$}\alpha{\$} system activity and specifically with plasma sTNFR1 concentrations.},

Exaggerated separation and patterning result from the dynamics of movement. Inferences about individual motives can usually not be drawn from aggregate patterns. Some unexpected phenomena, like density and vacancy, are generated. gan A general theory of 'tipping' begins to emerge.},

abstract = {We present a model of political networks that integrates both the choice of trade partners (the extensive margin) and trade volumes (the intensive margin). Our model predicts that regimes secure in their survival, including democracies and consolidated authoritarian regimes, will trade more on the extensive margin than vulnerable autocracies, which will block trade in products that would expand interpersonal contact among their citizens. We then apply a two-stage Bayesian LASSO estimator to detailed measures of institutional features, and highly disaggregated product-level data encompassing 131 countries over a half century. Consistent with our model, we find that (i) political institutions matter more for the extensive than the intensive margin of trade, (ii) while some characteristics of democracy promote trade, others tend to inhibit it, (iii) the effects of political institutions on trade vary across products falling most heavily on manufactures and differentiated products.},

abstract = {Health sector decentralization has been widely adopted to improve delivery of health services. While many argue that institutional capacities and mechanisms of accountability required to transform decentralized decision-making into improvements in local health systems are lacking, few empirical studies exist which measure or relate together these concepts. Based on research instruments administered to a sample of 91 health sector decision-makers in 17 districts of Pakistan, this study analyzes relationships between three dimensions of decentralization: decentralized authority (referred to as " decision space" ), institutional capacities, and accountability to local officials. Composite quantitative indicators of these three dimensions were constructed within four broad health functions (strategic and operational planning, budgeting, human resources management, and service organization/delivery) and on an overall/cross-function basis. Three main findings emerged. First, district-level respondents report varying degrees of each dimension despite being under a single decentralization regime and facing similar rules across provinces. Second, within dimensions of decentralization-particularly decision space and capacities-synergies exist between levels reported by respondents in one function and those reported in other functions (statistically significant coefficients of correlation ranging from {\$}\rho{\$}= 0.22 to {\$}\rho{\$}= 0.43). Third, synergies exist across dimensions of decentralization, particularly in terms of an overall indicator of institutional capacities (significantly correlated with both overall decision space ({\$}\rho{\$}= 0.39) and accountability ({\$}\rho{\$}= 0.23)). This study demonstrates that decentralization is a varied experience-with some district-level officials making greater use of decision space than others and that those who do so also tend to have more capacity to make decisions and are held more accountable to elected local officials for such choices. These findings suggest that Pakistan's decentralization policy should focus on synergies among dimensions of decentralization to encouraging more use of de jure decision space, work toward more uniform institutional capacity, and encourage greater accountability to local elected officials. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Multiplicative interaction models are widely used in social science to examine whether the relationship between an outcome and an independent variable changes with a moderating variable. Current empirical practice tends to overlook two important problems. First, these models assume a linear interaction effect that changes at a constant rate with the moderator. Second, estimates of the conditional effects of the independent variable can be misleading if there is a lack of common support of the moderator. Replicating 46 interaction effects from 22 recent publications in five top political science journals, we find that these core assumptions often fail in practice, suggesting that a large portion of findings across all political science subfields based on interaction models are modeling artifacts or are at best highly model dependent. We propose a checklist of simple diagnostics to assess the validity of these assumptions and offer flexible estimation strategies that allow for nonlinear interaction effects and safeguard against excessive extrapolation. These statistical routines are available in both R and STATA.},

However, there is a paucity of research on the external validity of these methods that examines whether the determinants that explain hypothetical choices made by survey respondents match the determinants that explain what subjects actually do when making similar choices in real-world situations. This study compares results from conjoint and vignette analyses on which immigrant attributes generate support for naturalization with closely corresponding behavioral data from a natural experiment in Switzerland, where some municipalities used referendums to decide on the citizenship applications of foreign residents. Using a representative sample from the same population and the official descriptions of applicant characteristics that voters received before each referendum as a behavioral benchmark, we find that the effects of the applicant attributes estimated from the survey experiments perform remarkably well in recovering the effects of the same attributes in the behavioral benchmark. We also find important differences in the relative performances of the different designs. Overall, the paired conjoint design, where respondents evaluate two immigrants side by side, comes closest to the behavioral benchmark; on average, its estimates are within 2{\%} percentage points of the effects in the behavioral benchmark.},

abstract = {Using comparable fiscal incidence analysis, this paper examines the impact of fiscal policy on inequality and poverty in twenty-five countries for around 2010. Success in fiscal redistribution is driven primarily by redistributive effort (share of social spending to GDP in each country) and the extent to which transfers/subsidies are targeted to the poor and direct taxes targeted to the rich. While fiscal policy always reduces inequality, this is not the case with poverty. Fiscal policy increases poverty in four countries using US{\$}1.25/day PPP poverty line, in 8 countries using US{\$}2.50/day line, and 15 countries using the US {\$}4/day line (over and above market income poverty). While spending on pre-school and primary school is pro-poor (i.e., the per capita transfer declines with income) in almost all countries, pro-poor secondary school spending is less prevalent, and tertiary education spending tends to be progressive only in relative terms (i.e., equalizing but not pro-poor). Health spending is always equalizing except for Jordan.},

Scholars generally agree that federalism is quite strong in contemporary Brazil. This study examines how and why strong federalism reemerged in Brazil following twenty years of centralizing military rule. In brief, the 1964-1985 military regime tried but failed to transform the state-based organizational structure and power base of Brazil's traditional political elite; Brazil's "transitional" electoral cycle also reinforced the strength of state governors. Examples are provided of how subnational actors influenced the transition process in the national government and how state-based actors and interests challenge Brazil's efforts to consolidate its democracy.},

abstract = {Path dependence as a concept in institutional theories has become increasingly popular in economics and other social sciences. The key idea is that in a sequence of events, the latter events are not (completely) independent from those that occurred in the past. Yet, common usage of the concept often subsumes two markedly different models and approaches to understand historical sequencing. The two main processes of the past shaping the future - diffusion and developmental pathways - must be distinguished analytically. This paper juxtaposes (1) the unplanned "trodden path" that takes shape through the subsequent repeated use by other individuals of that spontaneously chosen path, and (2) the "branching pathways" or juncture at which one of the available alternative pathways must be chosen in order to continue a journey. Furthermore, the typical approaches and their explanatory purchase are discussed in reference to explanations of institutional change. The paper shows that the first path dependence theorem is too deterministic and inflexible, whereas the second approach is sufficiently supple to analyze various forms of institutional change. Pfadabh{\"{a}}ngigkeit wird in den Sozial- und Wirtschaftswissenschaften zunehmend als Konzept institutioneller Theorien angewendet. Der Grundgedanke ist, dass in einer Sequenz von Ereignissen (oder Entscheidungen) sp{\"{a}}tere nicht (vollkommen) unabh{\"{a}}ngig von vorangegangenen sind. Jedoch wird in g{\"{a}}ngigen Anwendungen des Konzepts oft vers{\"{a}}umt, nach zwei {\"{a}}u{\ss}erst unterschiedlichen Verst{\"{a}}ndnissen historischer Sequenzen zu differenzieren. Die zwei Prozesse der Strukturierung der Zukunft durch die Vergangenheit - Diffusionspfade und Entwicklungspfade - sollen analytisch getrennt werden. Dieser Aufsatz unterscheidet (1) den zuf{\"{a}}lligen "Trampelpfad", welcher durch die vermehrte Benutzung eines Pfades spontan entsteht, von (2) dem "Scheideweg", an dem einer der m{\"{o}}glichen Pfade gew{\"{a}}hlt werden muss, um den Weg fortzusetzen. Im Weiteren wird der Erkl{\"{a}}rungsbeitrag der beiden Ans{\"{a}}tze in Bezug auf die Erkl{\"{a}}rung institutionellen Wandels er{\"{o}}rtert. Es zeigt sich, dass das erste Pfadabh{\"{a}}ngigkeitstheorem zu deterministisch und inflexibel ist, der zweite Pfadabh{\"{a}}ngigkeitsansatz hingegen offen genug, unterschiedliche Formen institutionellen Wandels zu analysieren.

abstract = {Little theoretical work exists that proposes general mechanisms for how public policies may influence child development. This article argues that dynamic systems theories may be useful in illuminating such processes, as well as highlighting gaps in current research at the intersection of public policy analysis and developmental science. A brief review of dynamic systems theories as they are currently utilized in other areas of developmental science is provided, as well as a statement of why they may help advance research in public policy and child development. Five principles of dynamic systems theories are presented and discussed using examples from research that address the question, "How do current antipoverty and welfare reform policies affect children?" Also presented are examples of hypotheses and research questions that each principle may generate for future work. The concluding section presents challenges that each principle poses for research methodology, and potential uses of the dynamic systems approach for developing and integrating policy and program initiatives.},

abstract = {A vast literature suggests that voters in new democracies ‘sell' their vote to patrons providing private or small-scale club goods, or, alternatively, that such goods are distributed along ethnic lines to reinforce ethnic voting. In either case the outcome is undermining democratic accountability. This study finds that citizens in one new democracy – Ghana – expect (and get) the patronage but at the same time engage in economic voting. Eighty-five percent of citizens first and foremost expect their legislators to supply private or small-scale ‘club' goods. This acts as a strong incentive for politicians to actually supply such goods, which is confirmed by participants' observational data and more than 250 interviews conducted by the author. Despite this, citizens do not vote based on how well or how poorly incumbent MPs provide clientelistic goods. A multivariate analysis reveals that voting for the opposition or the incumbent is determined by evaluations of the state of the national economy and of the government's policies. What the literature has portrayed as an ‘either-or' is ‘both', and this is perfectly rational: Extract as much as one can in terms of private and small club goods but vote based on economic factors. The literature suggests that clientelism dominates elections in newer democracies and thus undermines democracy. The findings from this study suggest that while distribution of clientelistic goods is common, this does not necessarily undermine the mechanism of democratic accountability in elections.},

abstract = {Cities can be thought of as the absence of physical space between people and firms. As such, they exist to eliminate transportation costs for goods, people and ideas and transportation technologies dictate urban form. In the 21st century, the dominant form of city living is based on the automobile and this form is sometimes called sprawl. In this essay, we document that sprawl is ubiquitous and that it is continuing to expand. Using a variety of evidence, we argue that sprawl is not the result of explicit government policies or bad urban planning, but rather the inexorable product of car-based living. Sprawl has been associated with significant improvements in quality of living, and the environmental impacts of sprawl have been offset by technological change. Finally, we suggest that the primary social problem associated with sprawl is the fact that some people are left behind because they do not earn enough to afford the cars that this form of living requires.},

abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between the February 2012 New York City teacher quality data release, the racial and ethnic composition of elementary and middle public schools and their neighborhoods, and housing prices. A unique dataset that links teacher quality to school characteristics, housing prices and characteristics, and Census data is used to estimate a difference-in-difference model to estimate the impact of the teacher quality release on housing prices. These results are then used to estimate the impact of the data release on residential and school demographics. The results in this study provide the first evidence of the effects of teacher quality measures on the housing market in New York City and the demographic shifts in residential and school mobility patterns as a result. The data suggests that the housing market responds significantly to the new information that was provided by the release of the teacher quality information, even when taking into consideration the school grades and other variables that may influence teacher quality measures. The magnitude of how much housing prices increase is greatly impacted by certain neighborhood demographics and the results show that Hispanic neighborhoods with a high proportion of free and reduced price lunch students are among the neighborhoods that had the highest increase in housing prices due to the teacher quality release. Not only that, but the areas that had the highest increase in housing prices due to the teacher quality release have experienced increases in the proportion of white students and the neighborhoods are becoming more racially diverse.},

@article{Jacob2012x,
abstract = {Regression discontinuity (RD) analysis is a rigorous nonexperimental approach that can be used to estimate program impacts in situations in which candidates are selected for treatment based on whether their value for a numeric rating exceeds a designated threshold or cut-point. Over the last two decades, the regression discontinuity approach has been used to evaluate the impact of a wide variety of social programs (DiNardo and Lee, 2004; Hahn, Todd, and van der Klaauw, 1999; Lemieux and Milligan, 2004; van der Klaauw, 2002; Angrist and Lavy, 1999; Jacob and Lefgren, 2006; McEwan and Shapiro, 2008; Black, Galdo, and Smith, 2007; Gamse, Bloom, Kemple, and Jacob, 2008). Yet, despite the growing popularity of the approach, there is only a limited amount of accessible information to guide researchers in the implementation of an RD design. While the approach is intuitively appealing, the statistical details regarding the implementation of an RD design are more complicated than they might first appear. Most of the guidance that currently exists appears in technical journals that require a high degree of technical sophistication to read. Furthermore, the terminology that is used is not well defined and is often used inconsistently. Finally, while a number of different approaches to the implementation of an RD design are proposed in the literature, they each differ slightly in their details. As such, even researchers with a fairly sophisticated statistical background can find it difficult to access practical guidance for the implementation of an RD design. To help fill this void, the present paper is intended to serve as a practitioners' guide to implementing RD designs. It seeks to explain things in easy-to-understand language and to offer best practices and general guidance to those attempting an RD analysis. In addition, the guide illustrates the various techniques available to researchers and explores their strengths and weaknesses using a simulated dataset, which can be accessed here. The guide provides a general overview of the RD approach and then covers the following topics in detail: (1) graphical presentation in RD analysis, (2) estimation (both parametric and nonparametric), (3) establishing the interval validity of RD impacts, (4) the precision of RD estimates, (5) the generalizability of RD findings, and (6) estimation and precision in the context of a fuzzy RD analysis. Readers will find both a glossary of widely used terms and a checklist of steps to follow when implementing an RD design in the Appendixes.},

abstract = {Survey experiments are a core tool for causal inference. Yet, the design of classical survey experiments prevents them from identifying which components of a multidimensional treatment are influential. Here, we show how conjoint analysis, an experimental design yet to be widely applied in political science, enables researchers to estimate the causal effects of multiple treatment components and assess several causal hypotheses simultaneously. In conjoint analysis, respondents score a set of alternatives, where each has randomly varied attributes. Here, we undertake a formal identification analysis to integrate conjoint analysis with the potential outcomes framework for causal inference. We propose a new causal estimand and show that it can be nonparametrically identified and easily estimated from conjoint data using a fully randomized design. The analysis enables us to propose diagnostic checks for the identification assumptions. We then demonstrate the value of these techniques through empirical applications to voter decision making and attitudes toward immigrants.},

abstract = {Segregation markedly enhances the visibility of a group; it makes it seem larger and more menacing than it is. – Gordon Allport 1 In 2008, the first time that every American voter had a chance to vote for a Black man for President, there was a striking pattern. In some counties, white voters cast far fewer votes for Barack Obama than they had for previous Democratic candidates. For example, in Floyd County, in eastern Kentucky, white voters cast only about 49 percent of their votes for Obama, while, only four years earlier, they had cast 63 percent of their votes for John Kerry. This shift away from voting Democrat was seen in many counties across the United States. 2 In fact, in many counties, Obama received a smaller share of votes than had any of the previous four Democratic candidates. Of course, there are many reasons this could have happened. But given that the troubled presidency of George W. Bush and the 2008 economic crisis meant it was a favorable election year for Democrats, 3 it seems likely that race may have played a role – that white people were driven away from their traditional party loyalties by a Black man on the ballot. We might imagine that if we had gone to these counties during the 2008 election, we would have found petty demagogues using race to stir up fear by implanting negative stereotypes of Blacks and of a Black president into the minds of white voters. Some of these demagogues did exist, but in this book, we are searching for something more systematic, something that will affect voters' attitudes and behavior regardless of the actions of any particular politician. Indeed, if we zoom out and look for patterns in the data, we see that in 2008, the demagogue was not any local politician, but rather geographic space itself. Looking across the country, we see that white voters in the most-segregated counties were between five and six percentage points less likely to vote for Obama than white 34 Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https:},

abstract = {Can formal democratic institutions succeed if they are built in societies with inhospitable social and economic conditions? In particular, will attempts to hold competitive elections fail to strengthen democracy in poor and divided nation states, as well as in regions such as the Middle East which are dominated by autocracy? Skeptics point to an earlier wave of institution building, when European-style parliaments were transplanted to many African societies during the era of decolonization, including in Benin and Togo, only to collapse as the military usurped their powers.1 We first need to establish the influence of certain underlying economic and social conditions on democratic consolidation before proceeding to examine the impact of power- sharing institutions in subsequent chapters. As Dahl points out, where the underlying conditions are highly unfavorable, then it is improbable that democracy could be preserved by any constitutional design. By contrast, if the underlying conditions are highly favorable, then democratic consolidation is likely with almost any constitution.2 But many cases fall into the muddy middle-ground. The analysis of cross-sectional time-series data illuminates the general patterns and what conditions count, focusing upon examining the role of wealth, the size of nation states, colonial legacies, regional diffusion, and the degree of ethnic heterogeneity. Each of these factors can be regarded as ‘structural' constraints on political development, meaning that it is difficult for domestic policymakers or the international community to alter these conditions in the medium to short-term, if at all; for example countries cannot change their histories or chose their neighboring states, although they can attempt to grow their economy. The East Asian cases of South Korea and Singapore provide further insights into how certain structural factors facilitate, but do not determine, democratic consolidation. Both Asian societies have experienced rapidly economic transformation in recent decades, yet South Korea has adopted multiparty elections and strengthened human rights, with the regimes rated by Freedom House as equivalent to Greece or Israel, while Singapore is rated only ‘partly free' by Freedom House. The contrasts help to explain the strengths – and limits – of socioeconomic explanations of democratization.},

Previous work explaining the process of Mexican democratization focuses on foreign pressures, interparty bargaining and a unified PRI. Alternatively, we argue that internal divisions in the PRI-conjoined with the threat of a presidential deal with the opposition-determined the particular shape of the reform. The article uses a bargaining model to illustrate the conjunction of interests between the President and PRI hard-liners while taking into account the shadow role played by the opposition. We argue, finally, that the model can be extended to aid explanations of other democratic transitions, as well as general cases of majority-party decision-making and coalition bargaining.},

abstract = {Under what conditions do politicians emphasize patronage allocations over the provision of public goods? Building upon research on democratic policy management, this paper aims to improve our understanding of patronage politics by focusing upon the political incentives influencing the ability and willingness of politicians to target public sector allocations to political supporters. Drawing upon data on spending priorities at the provincial level in post-1983 Argentina, the statistical analysis provides evidence that the relative importance of patronage allocations fluctuates with partisanship, electoral cycles, revenue sources, and public sector investment in economic development. The findings underline important and largely neglected parallels between clientelistic and programmatic politics and thereby have important implications for the study of the political economy of democracy.},

abstract = {Social experiments have become the benchmark method for estimating the program impacts of policy interventions, but are not always available. Non experimental evaluation methods provide an alternative to the experimental design, but their results depend on stronger non-testable assumptions and therefore are less clear and more controversial. We present evidence on the reliability of a non experimental method, propensity score matching, in the estimation of program impacts. We apply propensity score matching to estimate the bias associated with the treatment on the treated effect of a Mexican anti-poverty program on outcomes such as food expenditure and its composition, and children's schooling and employment. We compare the results of the experimental impact evaluation of the program with those using matched samples drawn from a nationally representative household survey. Our results show that simple cross-sectional matching does well in replicating the benchmark for outcomes that are measured using similar survey instruments. However, for outcomes that are measured using different survey instruments we find significant differences between the benchmark and the results based on matching.},

abstract = {This paper is one in a series of World Bank Working Papers that seeks to document the experience of Brazil's Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia Program. It highlights the key “nuts and bolts” of designing and implementing the BFP in Brazil's decentralized context. Like other conditional cash transfers (CCTs), the BFP seeks to help (a) reduce current poverty and inequality, by providing a minimum level of income for extremely poor families; and (b) break the intergenerational transmission of poverty by conditioning these transfers on beneficiary compliance with human capital requirements (school attendance, vaccines, pre-natal visits). The program also seeks to help empower BFP beneficiaries by linking them to other complementary services. As the largest conditional cash transfer in the developing world, the BFP has attracted significant attention both in Brazil and beyond. As such, this paper has two key audiences – and two corresponding objectives. First, the primary audience is international, given world-wide interest in the Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia Program. This international target audience thus includes: policy makers, practitioners, and potential future practitioners of CCTs working in other countries who are interested in learning more abut Brazil's experience with the BFP, particularly given its decentralized context. For this audience, the paper highlights some of the key features of the program including: • The program as a reform program, which consolidated four pre-reform programs into one, building on Brazil's decade of experience with CCTs; • The size and rapid expansion of the program, now reaching 11.1 million families (over 46 million people), making it the largest program of this type in the world; • The very impressive targeting accuracy of the program, and the recently demonstrated impacts on reducing poverty and inequality; • The implementation of the BFP in Brazil's decentralized context and the development and use of innovative performance-based management mechanisms to promote incentives for quality implementation in this context so as to overcome the “principal-agent” dilemma; • The role of the BFP as a unifying force in social policy, integrating social policy both horizontally across sectors and vertically across levels of government; and • The “natural laboratory for innovation” that has emerged in Brazil's decentralized context, for experimenting with exit policies and graduation approaches. Second, the topic is clearly of interest to audiences in Brazil. As such, we seek to document the evolution of the design and implementation of the BFP under the first Lula Administration, taking stock of the main advances and highlighting key priorities for the future, including: • Priority actions for further strengthening of the “basic architecture” of the program: strengthening conditionalities monitoring, fine-tuning targeting, expanding coverage to reduce errors of exclusion, and enhancing oversight and controls; and • Possible innovations for the graduation agenda, including: (a) enhancing educational conditionalities (via bonuses for grade completion and graduation and incentives for older children to attend school); and (b) linking BFP beneficiaries to complementary services.},

abstract = {WHY do authoritarian states democratize? What accounts for the contours, dynamics, and ideologies of the nation-state? Under what conditions do civil wars and revolutions erupt? Why is political representation channeled through political parties in contemporary democracies? Why do some parties run on policy programs, others on patronage? Can citizens use elections and courts to hold governments accountable? These are some of the crucial questions that comparative political scientists address. And they are the questions, among others, around which this volume is organized. We asked a set of top scholars in the field of comparative politics to write critical surveys of areas of scholarship in which they are expert. We assembled the volume with two guiding principles. First, we are committed to the possibility (and desirability) of generating a systematic body of theoretical knowledge about politics. The discipline advances, we believe, through theoretical discovery and innovation. Second, we embrace a catholic approach to comparative methodology. In the following paragraphs we offer an overview of our authors' contributions, with occasional critical commentary of our own or additional thoughts on the directions in which future research should go.},

abstract = {Delivery of public goods varies significantly across the Indian states.This article argues that dif- ferences in state government expenditures are largely the result of differences in their party sys- tems. Using macroeconomic data from 1967 to 1997 as well as postelection voter surveys, we demonstrate that states with two-party competition provide more public goods than states with multiparty competition, which, we argue, reflects differing mobilization strategies. In two-party systems, political parties require support from many social groups and therefore provide public goodsto win elections. In multiparty systems, needing only a plurality of votes to win, parties use club, rather than public, goods to mobilize smaller segments of the population. In stressing the impact of party systems on state government performancein India, this article differs from recent political economy research, which has stressed either the effect of particular political parties or ethnic divisions on government performance and public goods delivery.

abstract = {Study objective: The evidence supporting the effect of income inequality on health has been largely observed in societies far more egalitarian than the US. This study examines the cross sectional multilevel associations between income inequality and self rated poor health in Chile; a society more unequal than the US. Design: A multilevel statistical framework of 98 344 people nested within 61 978 households nested within 285 communities nested within 13 regions. Setting: The 2000 National Socioeconomic Characterization Survey (CASEN) data from Chile. Participants: Adults aged 18 and above. The outcome was a dichotomised self rated health (0 if very good, good or average; 1 if poor, or very poor). Individual level exposures included age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, education, employment status, type of health insurance, and household level exposures include income and residential setting (urban/rural). Community level exposures included the Gini coefficient and median income. Main results: Controlling for individual/household predictors, a significant gradient was observed between income and poor self rated health, with very poor most likely to report poor health (OR: 2.94) followed by poor (OR: 2.77), low (OR: 2.06), middle (OR: 1.73), high (OR: 1.38) as compared with the very high income earners. Controlling for household and community effects of income, a significant effect of community income inequality was observed (OR:1.22). Conclusions: Household income does not explain any of the between community differences; neither does it account for the effect of community income inequality on self rated health, with more unequal communities associated with a greater probability of reporting poor health},

abstract = {Regression discontinuity (RD) analysis is a rigorous nonexperimental approach that can be used to estimate program impacts in situations in which candidates are selected for treatment based on whether their value for a numeric rating exceeds a designated threshold or cut-point. Over the last two decades, the regression discontinuity approach has been used to evaluate the impact of a wide variety of social programs (DiNardo and Lee, 2004; Hahn, Todd, and van der Klaauw, 1999; Lemieux and Milligan, 2004; van der Klaauw, 2002; Angrist and Lavy, 1999; Jacob and Lefgren, 2006; McEwan and Shapiro, 2008; Black, Galdo, and Smith, 2007; Gamse, Bloom, Kemple, and Jacob, 2008). Yet, despite the growing popularity of the approach, there is only a limited amount of accessible information to guide researchers in the implementation of an RD design. While the approach is intuitively appealing, the statistical details regarding the implementation of an RD design are more complicated than they might first appear. Most of the guidance that currently exists appears in technical journals that require a high degree of technical sophistication to read. Furthermore, the terminology that is used is not well defined and is often used inconsistently. Finally, while a number of different approaches to the implementation of an RD design are proposed in the literature, they each differ slightly in their details. As such, even researchers with a fairly sophisticated statistical background can find it difficult to access practical guidance for the implementation of an RD design. To help fill this void, the present paper is intended to serve as a practitioners' guide to implementing RD designs. It seeks to explain things in easy-to-understand language and to offer best practices and general guidance to those attempting an RD analysis. In addition, the guide illustrates the various techniques available to researchers and explores their strengths and weaknesses using a simulated dataset, which can be accessed here. The guide provides a general overview of the RD approach and then covers the following topics in detail: (1) graphical presentation in RD analysis, (2) estimation (both parametric and nonparametric), (3) establishing the interval validity of RD impacts, (4) the precision of RD estimates, (5) the generalizability of RD findings, and (6) estimation and precision in the context of a fuzzy RD analysis. Readers will find both a glossary of widely used terms and a checklist of steps to follow when implementing an RD design in the Appendixes.},

abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between state-funded secondary school performance and local residential property values in seven major English cities. When choosing which secondary school they wish their children to attend, parents will be aware of the school's performance in Key Stage 3, GCSE and A- level examinations. We suggest that GCSE examination results will be the measure of school performance that parental choice will be most closely correlated with. Therefore, secondary schools with good GCSE examination results will be “oversubscribed” in that more students will wish to attend these schools than there are places available. Schools will then have to develop mechanisms for rationing the available places - central to rationing strategies in English schools at the moment is geographical proximity of the family home to the school of choice. Parents will thus have a strong incentive to purchase houses in the “catchment” area of high performing schools. Our results suggest that this is the case, with high performing schools stimulating a price premium in local residential property markets of between 1{\%} and 3{\%} for each additional 10{\%} point improvement in the pass rate in GCSE examinations.},

We develop a common theoretical framework to examine alternative scenarios, characterizing conditions under which poverty traps (in the sense of multiple stable steady states) arise, as opposed to (possibly, conditional) convergence to a unique steady state. We apply this framework to discuss the relative merits of alternative anti-poverty policies, such as unconditional and condi- tional cash transfers, and direct interventions aimed at improving market access to the poor or improving public service delivery},

abstract = {Do controlled comparisons still have a place in comparative politics? Long criticized by quantitatively oriented methodologists, this canonical approach has increasingly been critiqued by qualitative methodologists who recom- mend greater focus on within-case analysis and the confinement of causal explanations to particular cases. Such advice accords with a welcome shift from a combative “tale of two cultures” toward mutual respect for research combining qualitative and quantitative methods in the simultaneous pursuit of internal and external validity. This article argues that controlled comparisons remain indispensable amid this “multimethod turn,” explicating how they too can generate both internal and external validity when their practitioners (a) craft arguments with general variables or mechanisms, (b) seek out rep- resentative variation, and (c) select cases that maximize control over alterna- tive explanations. When controlled comparisons meet these standards, they continue to illuminate the world's great convergences and divergences across nation-states in a manner that no other methods can surpass.},

abstract = {Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a local spatial statistical technique for exploring spatial nonstationarity. Previous approaches to mapping the results of GWR have primarily employed an equal step classification and sequential no-hue colour scheme for choropleth mapping of parameter estimates. This cartographic approach may hinder the exploration of spatial nonstationarity by inadequately illustrating the spatial distribution of the sign, magnitude, and significance of the influence of each explanatory variable on the dependent variable. Approaches for improving mapping of the results of GWR are illustrated using a case study analysis of population densitymedian home value relationships in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. These approaches employ data classification schemes informed by the (nonspatial) data distribution, diverging colour schemes, and bivariate choropleth mapping.},

abstract = {This chapter introduces the reader to comparative historical analysis (CHA), one of the oldest methods in the social science repertoire. CHA is characterized by its emphasis on historically contextualized comparisons explicitly aimed at producing causal arguments about the macro-sociological phenomena. After a theoretical overview that discusses the method's nature, logic, and central concepts, the chapter turns its attention to practical matters. Thus, rather than an extended scientific discussion of what CHA is, the chapter seeks to encourage interested students by providing them with a series of tools and techniques that can be used when doing comparative historical research on social movements and revolutions. More specifically, the chapter offers a five-step approach: research design and puzzle formulation; data identification; the use of data; data analysis; and the writing process. A discussion on the use of technology in the research process is present throughout the practical part of the chapter.},

Nonparametric tests are also used to discern patterns of similarity and difference .

@article{Levitsky2003,
abstract = {The Argentine (Peronist) Justicialista Party (PJ) underwent a farreaching coalitional transformation during the 1980s and 1990s. Party reformers dismantled Peronism's traditional mechanisms of labor participation, and clientelist networks replaced unions as the primary linkage to the working and lower classes. By the early 1990s, the PJ had transformed from a labor-dominated party into a machine party in which unions were relatively marginal actors. This process of de-unionization was critical to the PJ's electoral and policy success during the presidency of Carlos Menem (1989-99). The erosion of union influence facilitated efforts to attract middle-class votes and eliminated a key source of internal opposition to the government's economic reforms. At the same time, the consolidation of clientelist networks helped the PJ maintain its traditional working- and lower-class base in a context of economic crisis and neoliberal reform. This article argues that Peronism's radical de-unionization was facilitated by the weakly institutionalized nature of its traditional party-union linkage. Although unions dominated the PJ in the early 1980s, the rules of the game governing their participation were always informal, fluid, and contested, leaving them vulnerable to internal changes in the distribution of power. Such a change occurred during the 1980s, when office-holding politicians used patronage resources to challenge labor's privileged position in the party. When these politicians gained control of the party in 1987, Peronism's weakly institutionalized mechanisms of union participation collapsed, paving the way for the consolidation of machine politics--and a steep decline in union influence--during the 1990s.},

This article addresses the conceptual and practical difficulties of achieving such a synthesis by evaluating several strategies for integrating voluntarist and structural factors in the analysis of regime change. It examines competing ways of conceptualizing agency and structure and assesses the varied consequences that different conceptualizations have for explaining regime transformation. The article also analyzes three distinct strategies for integrating agency and structure: the funnel, path-dependent, and eclectic strategies. Each integrative strategy isanchored by a different conceptual base and has characteristic strengths and limitations. The conclusion explores future directions for developing integrative strategies.},

abstract = {Qualitative studies of vote buying find the practice to be common in many Latin American countries, but quantitative studies using surveys find little evidence of vote buying. Social desirability bias can account for this discrepancy. We employ a survey-based list experiment to minimize the problem. After the 2008 Nicaraguan municipal elections, we asked about vote-buying behavior by campaigns using a list experiment and the questions traditionally used by studies of vote buying on a nationally representative survey. Our list experiment estimated that 24{\%} of registered voters in Nicaragua were offered a gift or service in exchange for votes, whereas only 2{\%} reported the behavior when asked directly. This detected social desirability bias is nonrandom and analysis based on traditional obtrusive measures of vote buying is unreliable. We also provide systematic evidence that shows the importance of monitoring strategies by parties in determining who is targeted for vote buying.},

abstract = {In democratic elections, candidates and parties promise to deliver public goods to segments of the electorate in order to win their support at the polls. In new democracies, especially in rural agrarian societies, existing networks of clientelist politics can alter this logic, so that candidates instead promise private goods to patrons in return for those rural patrons delivering the votes of their clients. This suggests that in such regimes, the distribution of public goods spending by the government should vary inversely with the strength of clientelist networks. Specifically, we propose that the strength of patron-client ties varies according to whether peasants farm as smallholders, sharecroppers, fixed rent tenants, or landless laborers. Accordingly, the strength of rural patrons should vary across districts with the distribution of households among various land tenure categories. Our theory then suggests that where land tenure patterns render rural patrons weaker, elected governments should invest more resources in public goods in order to win the votes of peasants. Where land tenure patterns give patrons more control over peasant farmers, government spending on public goods should be lower because candidates and parties have to devote more resources to private benefits to the patrons. We test this proposition with district level data from Nepal on the patterns of land tenure and on the provision of public goods.},

Our answer to this question relies on uncertainty regarding the distribution of gains and losses from reform. We show that there is a bias towards the status quo (and hence against efficiency-enhancing reforms) whenever some of the individual gainers and losers from reform cannot be identified beforehand. There are reforms which, once adopted, will receive adequate political support but would have failed to carry the day ex ante. The argument does not rely on risk aversion, irrationality, or hysteresis due to sunk costs},

Only about one in ten voters is controlled by either clientelism or ethnic and family ties in choosing their political representatives, whereas about 85{\%} to 90{\%} voted as mature democratic citizens. Ethnicity is not a deciding factor in determining the vote in the country, whereas clientelism is encouraged by intense competition that can cause a dilemma for new democracies. The expertise of Ghanaians in negotiating their political interests is displayed in every election in which they showed their clarity of interest orientation. Most citizens in transitional democracies behave as mature democratic voters and they evaluate the policy programs of candidates and parties.},

These properties are treated as random fields, which renders nonlinear advection-reaction transport equations stochastic. We derive a deterministic equation for the probability density function (PDF) of the concentration of a solute that undergoes heterogeneous reactions, e.g., precipitation or dissolution. The derivation treats exactly (without linearization) a reactive term in the transport equation which accounts for uncertainty (randomness) in both flow velocity and kinetic rate constants but requires a closure, such as a Large-Eddy-Diffusivity (LED) approximation used in the present analysis. No closure is required when reaction rates are the only source of uncertainty. We use exact concentration PDFs obtained for this setting to analyze the accuracy of our general, LED-based PDF equations.},

abstract = {We report new estimates of measures of absolute poverty for the developing world for the period 1981-2004. A clear trend decline in the percentage of people who are absolutely poor is evident, although with uneven progress across regions. We find more mixed success in reducing the total number of poor. Indeed, the developing world outside China has seen little or no sustained progress in reducing the number of poor, with rising poverty counts in some regions, notably sub-Saharan Africa. There are encouraging signs of progress in all regions after 2000, although it is too early to say whether this is a new trend. We also summarize results from estimating a new series incorporating an allowance for the higher cost of living facing poor people in urban areas. This reveals a marked urbanization of poverty in the developing world, which is stronger in some regions than others, although it remains that three-quarters of the poor live in rural areas.},

abstract = {Can formal democratic institutions succeed if they are built in societies with inhospitable social and economic conditions? In particular, will attempts to hold competitive elections fail to strengthen democracy in poor and divided nation states, as well as in regions such as the Middle East which are dominated by autocracy? Skeptics point to an earlier wave of institution building, when European-style parliaments were transplanted to many African societies during the era of decolonization, including in Benin and Togo, only to collapse as the military usurped their powers.1 We first need to establish the influence of certain underlying economic and social conditions on democratic consolidation before proceeding to examine the impact of power- sharing institutions in subsequent chapters. As Dahl points out, where the underlying conditions are highly unfavorable, then it is improbable that democracy could be preserved by any constitutional design. By contrast, if the underlying conditions are highly favorable, then democratic consolidation is likely with almost any constitution.2 But many cases fall into the muddy middle-ground. The analysis of cross-sectional time-series data illuminates the general patterns and what conditions count, focusing upon examining the role of wealth, the size of nation states, colonial legacies, regional diffusion, and the degree of ethnic heterogeneity. Each of these factors can be regarded as ‘structural' constraints on political development, meaning that it is difficult for domestic policymakers or the international community to alter these conditions in the medium to short-term, if at all; for example countries cannot change their histories or chose their neighboring states, although they can attempt to grow their economy. The East Asian cases of South Korea and Singapore provide further insights into how certain structural factors facilitate, but do not determine, democratic consolidation. Both Asian societies have experienced rapidly economic transformation in recent decades, yet South Korea has adopted multiparty elections and strengthened human rights, with the regimes rated by Freedom House as equivalent to Greece or Israel, while Singapore is rated only ‘partly free' by Freedom House. The contrasts help to explain the strengths – and limits – of socioeconomic explanations of democratization.},

abstract = {This paper measures the impact of Service Delivery improvements in basic infrastructure, health, education and crime on the levels of political and institutional support, looking at the experience of Medellin barrios (2003-2009). The paper draws on the hypotheses raised in previous interviews by Medellin public officials, business groups and civil society organizations. The qualitative analysis suggested that a quick upgrading in the city's less favored districts, combined with a stronger enforcement of the rule of law, may have successfully raised the traditionally low levels of political and institutional support in the city, breaking the equilibrium of distrust in government. This paper provides quantitative empirical evidence supporting these findings, and it also assess the relative importance of procedural (or administrative) fairness, perceptions of improvements in service delivery, actual service delivery, and satisfaction with services, as possible alternative channels to rebuild trust in institutions. The paper also examines the spillover effects in trust between institutions. For this estimation, micro data from an extensive local opinion poll (Medellin Como Vamos) is used, covering citizens' assessments on service delivery and quality of government. Taking into account spatial and inter-temporal dimensions in Service Delivery, the analysis unveils how perceived improvements in different public services may have a distinct impact on citizens' perceptions of government performance and trustworthiness.},

I estimate the causal effect of school quality as measured by average test scores on housing rents, by using a regression discontinuity design to control for unobserved characteristics of neighborhoods. Specifically, I focus on apartment buildings located within school attendance district boundaries. I find that school quality has a significantly positive effect on housing rents of apartments for families, but school quality does not have a significant effect on housing rents of dwellings for single people. These results show that parents are willing to pay more to send their children to a better school.},

Policies designed to end ethnic outbidding and the ethnicisation of party politics have resulted in higher levels of ethnic violence. Policies pursued by the Nigerian framers to ‘get the party system right' and engender broad, ethnically diverse parties were also expected to reduce the incentives for elites to encourage ethnic violence. They have not. The Peoples' Democratic Party (PDP) succeeds as a multi-ethnic coalition on the basis of informal bargains and accommodations. The practice of ‘zoning', which distributes the spoils of office according to an ethnic formula, produces incentives for local elites to embark upon ethnic violence or ethnic mobilisation as a way of advancing the interests of their local constituencies. The institutional framework of Nigerian democracy creates incentives for ‘two-faced' elites – cooperative nationally, but ethnically antagonistic in their home districts.},

The policy maker is thus trapped into a position in which self‐fulfilling expectations dictate not only the coordination outcome but also the optimal policy. This result does not rely on the freedom to choose out‐of‐equilibrium beliefs, nor on the policy being a public signal; it may obtain even if the policy is observed with idiosyncratic noise.

abstract = {Abstract Objective: To examine the relation between health outcomes and the equality with which income is distributed in the United States. Design: The degree of income inequality, defined as the percentage of total household income received by the less well off 50{\%} of households, and changes in income inequality were calculated for the 50 states in 1980 and 1990. These measures were then examined in relation to all cause mortality adjusted for age for each state, age specific deaths, changes in mortalities, and other health outcomes and potential pathways for 1980, 1990, and 1989-91. Main outcome measure: Age adjusted mortality from all causes. Results: There was a significant correlation (r=0.62, P{\textless}0.001) between the percentage of total household income received by the less well off 50{\%} in each state and all cause mortality, unaffected by adjustment for state median incomes. Income inequality was also significantly associated with age specific mortalities and rates of low birth weight, homicide, violent crime, work disability, expenditures on medical care and police protection, smoking, and sedentary activity. Rates of unemployment, imprisonment, recipients of income assistance and food stamps, lack of medical insurance, and educational outcomes were also worse as income inequality increased. Income inequality was also associated with mortality trends, and there was a suggestion of an impact of inequality trends on mortality trends. Conclusions: Variations between states in the inequality of the distribution of income are significantly associated with variations between states in a large number of health outcomes and social indicators and with mortality trends. These differences parallel relative investments in human and social capital. Economic policies that influence income and wealth inequality may have an important impact on the health of countries. Key messages There was a significant correlation (r=0.62) between the proportion of total household income received by the less well off 50{\%} of households and variation between states in death rates for the United States Income inequality was also significantly related to changes in mortality with smaller declines between 1980-90 in those states with greater income inequality Income inequality was associated with a large number of other health outcomes and with measures related to investments in human and social capital Economic policies that increase income inequality may also have a deleterious effect on population health},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Aim of this study was to compare the results of the surgical repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears with and without resection of the lateral clavicle. METHODS: 102 patients were retrospectively observed by an independent observer for a mean follow-up of 21 months (12 - 42). 93 patients had medium to large sized tears (1 - 5 cm) and 9 had massive tears ({\textgreater}5 cm). Additional resection of the lateral end of the clavicle was performed in 20 patients. The mean age of the 68 men and 34 woman was 57.3 years (28 - 80). For the evaluation the Constant score, the ASES score and the visual analogue scales for postoperative satisfaction, function, strength, pain and ADL were used. RESULTS: The subjective results were good to excellent in 79 patients (76 {\%}), fair in 14 patients (13.7 {\%}) and poor in 9 patients (8.9 {\%}), too. After surgery the Constant score was 87 {\%} of the contralateral side for all patients, 89 {\%} for group I and 84 {\%} for group II and the mean ASES score was 86 {\%}, 87 {\%} and 82 {\%} of the contralateral side. Comparing the pre- and post-operative values on the visual analogue scale pain and disability in ADL were decreased highly significantly in all patients (p {\textless}0.001). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: We conclude that in patients with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear the patient's satisfaction and function will improve after acromioplasty and rotator cuff repair. The results are not significantly influenced by an additional resection of the lateral clavicle.},

abstract = {This paper conducts a review of the literature concerning developmental states, in order to identify gaps and suggest research questions which could be fruitful for the Effective States and Inclusive Development Research Consortium to explore, within the remit of their proposed research programme. This literature review attends to three key questions about developmental states and the answers proposed to them within the literature, namely; what worked? Why did it work? And would it work elsewhere? It also examines an emerging literature suggesting other models of a developmental state more suited to contemporary circumstances, which focus more explicitly on development as a social phenomenon rather than as a purely economic one. These are of particular interest given ESIDs focus on inclusive development. The conclusions of the paper examine some of the gaps in the literature and suggest an agenda for future research which includes addressing questions around: How does the consensus of conducting developmental roles come about – and how is it sustained? Patrimonialism, personal rule, development and stability Role of education, especially higher/further education Importance of rural/agriculture policies},

abstract = {This study investigates whether income inequality is related to sprawl and wellbeing in American cities. The results do not provide evidence to support the role of income inequality as a mediator of the link between sprawl and well-being. Instead, the results tell a more nuanced story. Specifically, they indicate that consistent with a priori expectations, lower levels of sprawl are, on average, associated with lower levels of income inequality. Additionally, lower levels of sprawl correspond to higher levels of financial well-being. Supplementary investigation into this finding reveals that this disguises a very different experience among Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) with higher levels of financial wellbeing, in which lower sprawl corresponds more strongly to higher levels of financial well-being. While the evidence is not unimpeachable, these findings lend some support to conventional anti-sprawl urban planning wisdom for American cities.},

abstract = {The efficacy of a recombinant subunit West Nile (WN) vaccine candidate was determined in a hamster model of encephalitis. Animals included young, aged, and immunocompromised animals in an effort to simulate key groups at risk of WN virus-induced disease. Groups of aged (12 month old), weanling, and adult hamsters rendered leukopenic after immunization were immunized subcutaneously with a WN virus recombinant envelope protein (WN-80E) with or without WN virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) mixed with adjuvant or adjuvant alone. A challenge dose of wild-type WN virus was administered to produce 40-100{\%} mortality in the control hamsters. The recombinant antigen preparations containing WN-80E with or without WN NS1 gave similar results. Hamsters in both groups had a strong antibody response after immunization, and none of the aged or weanling animals became ill or developed detectable viremia after challenge with WN virus at 2 weeks after booster vaccination. However, mortality among the control animals (administered adjuvant without antigen) at 2 weeks after booster challenge was 40-60{\%}. In hamsters rendered leukopenic after immunization, survival rates up to 80{\%} were observed, and a low-level viremia was detected in the vaccinated and challenged hamsters. The survival rate was significantly (P{\textless}0.05) higher in animals vaccinated with a higher dose of WN-80E than a lower dose. The addition of NS1 did not significantly affect survival after challenge. In contrast, all of the control animals that received adjuvant only developed a very high level of viremia, and the mortality rate was 100{\%}. These findings indicate that the recombinant WN vaccines induced antibody in and afforded protection to young and aged hamsters and immunosuppressed hamsters},

Urban form was quantified using preexisting sprawl indexes and spatial metrics applied to remotely sensed land cover data. Air pollution data included the nonpoint source emission of the ozone (O3) precursors nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the concentration of O3, the concentration and nonpoint source emission of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) from on-road sources. Metropolitan areas that exhibited higher levels of urban sprawl, or sprawl-like urban morphologies, generally exhibited higher concentrations and emissions of air pollution and CO2 when controlling for population, land area, and climate.},

abstract = {In a recent article published in the Latin American Research Review, Si- mone Bohn analyzed electoral results and survey data from Brazil to contest several theses concerning the reelection of President Luiz In{\'{a}}cio Lula da Silva in 2006. In par- ticular, Bohn asserted that benefi ciaries of Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia, a conditional cash transfer program that was reaching eleven million families at the time of the 2006 election, were already supporters of Lula in 2002, and therefore the program could not have contrib- uted to the change in Lula's constituency between his election in 2002 and his reelection in 2006. We show that these claims are based on voter recall data collected between nine and fi fty-seven months after the elections, and that these data grossly overestimate actual electoral support for Lula—probably as a result of well-known reporting biases. Reanalysis of Bohn's data as well as analysis of more reliable surveys suggest that there were indeed signifi cant changes in voting patterns between 2002 and 2006, and that Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia did play an important role in the 2006 elections.

Even taking into account levels of economic development, the chances of an individual surviving through infancy, growing up literate, or living a healthy, long life vary dramatically across regions of the world, in different countries, and within the same country. What are the causes of such variation in wellbeing? This article points to a factor that has been virtually ignored in the vast scholarship on social welfare and development-the solidarity that emerges from a sense of shared identity. The argument marks an important departure from the traditional emphasis on the role of class and electoral politics, as well as from the dominant view of the negative implications of identity for welfare. Combining statistical analyses of all Indian states and a comparative historical analysis of two Indian provinces, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh, this article demonstrates how the strength of attachment to the subnational political community-subnationalism-can drive a progressive social policy and improve developmental outcomes.},

abstract = { This article argues that urban spatial expansion results mainly from three powerful forces: a growing population, rising incomes, and falling commuting costs. Urban growth occurring purely in response to these fundamental forces cannot be faulted as socially undesirable, but three market failures may distort their operation, upsetting the allocation of land between agricultural and urban uses and justifying criticism of urban sprawl. These are the failure to account for the benefits of open space, excessive commuting because of a failure to account for the social costs of congestion, and failure to make new development pay for the infrastructure costs it generates. Precise remedies for these market failures are two types of development taxes and congestion tolls levied on commuters. Each of these remedies leads to a reduction in the spatial size of the city. },

abstract = {We delineate the underlying homogeneity assumption, procedural variants, and implications of the comparative method and distinguish this from Mill's method of difference. We demonstrate that additional units can provide ‘‘placebo'' tests for the comparative method even if the scope of inference is limited to the two units under comparison. Moreover, such tests may be available even when these units are the most similar pair of units on the control variables with differing values of the independent variable. Small-n analyses using this method should therefore, at a minimum, clearly define the dependent, independent, and control variables so they may be measured for additional units, and specify how the control variables are weighted in defining similarity between units. When these tasks are too difficult, process tracing of a single unit may be a more appropriate method. We illustrate these points with applications to two studies. Keywords},

abstract = {This article presents a model of information manipulation and political regime change. There is a regime that can be overthrown but only if enough citizens participate in an uprising. Citizens are imperfectly informed about the regime's ability to resist an uprising and the regime can engage in propaganda that, taken at face-value, makes the regime seem stronger than it truly is. This coordination game with endogenous information manipulation has a unique equilibrium and the article gives a complete analytic characterization of the equilibrium's comparative statics. Holding fixed the number of signals available to citizens, if the per-unit signal precision is sufficiently high then the regime is harder to overthrow. In contrast, if the number of signals increases, so that both total signal precision and the regime's costs of manipulation rise together, then the regime is easier to overthrow unless there are strong economies of scale in information control.

abstract = {In theoretical models of residential sorting, a household's location decision is closely linked to its demand for local public services, such as schooling. Since school choice programs weaken the link between residential location and schooling options, they have the potential to affect both property values and residential location choices. Results derived from computable general equilibrium models suggest these effects could be large, but there is limited empirical evidence concerning whether they actually occur. This paper develops and tests predictions concerning the impact of inter-district choice programs on housing values and residential location decisions. Our empirical results strongly confirm our theoretical predictions and the findings of the computable general equilibrium literature: after their states adopt inter-district choice programs, districts with desirable nearby, out-of-district schooling options experience relatively large increases in housing values, residential income, and population density.},

abstract = {Increasing urbanisation and the proliferation of slums require a holistic understanding of the urban metabolism of cities. However, existing urban metabolic analyses exclude a detailed understanding of how urban slums function and contribute to biophysical, including energy, flows. This paper aims at filling this gap by critically investigating the notion of the urban slum in general, the extent to which it differs in the African context, specifically in South Africa, and broadening the understanding of urban slum based on the concept of urban metabolism, using the multi-scale integrated analysis of societal and ecosystem metabolism (MuSIASEM) approach, which was applied to the Enkanini informal settlement in Stellenbosch, South Africa. The analysis shows that South Africa has a more nuanced typology of the notion of urban slums categorised as: (i) townships; (ii) housing-turned-slum; (iii) squatter camps; (iv) site and service settlements; (v) transit camps; and (vi) hybrid multi-structured settlements. Beyond these definitions, the case study illustrates that urban slums, however defined, are complex systems with their own internal flows and processes that are connected in a myriad of ways to the larger urban system. The investigation into the use of Time, Money and Energy in the Enkanini case further revealed the productive (hypercyclic) and consumptive (dissipative) nature of the components of the urban informal settlement. This type of analysis reveals new insights into the linkages between urban informal settlements and the city.},

abstract = {Annotation QGIS is a user friendly open source geographic information system (GIS) that runs on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows. The popularity of open source geographic information systems and QGIS in particular has been growing rapidly over the last few years. More and more companies and institutions are adopting QGIS and even switching to QGIS as their main GIS. Learning QGIS 2.0 is a practical, hands-on guide that provides you with clear, step-by-step exercises that will help you to apply your GIS knowledge to QGIS. Containing a number of clear, practical exercises, this book will introduce you to working with QGIS, quickly and painlessly. If you want to take advantage of the wide range of functionalities that QGIS offers, then this is the book for you. This book takes you from installing and configuring QGIS, through handling spatial data to creating great maps. You will learn how to load and visualize existing spatial data and how to create data from scratch. You will perform common geoprocessing and spatial analysis tasks and automate them. We will cover how to achieve great cartographic output and print maps. You will learn everything you need to know to handle spatial data management, processing, and visualization tasks in QGIS.

Using local indicators of spatial association (LISA), the statistically significant areas of Democratic and Republican support are identified for both elections, thereby uncovering major sources of spatial autocorrelation in recent presidential voting. Most interestingly, the change in the presidential vote from 2004 to 2008 appears to be significantly more spatially dependent than the raw vote itself, suggesting that the so-called "Obama Effect" also exhibits a high degree of geographic clustering.},

abstract = {Conditional cash transfer programs, an innovation in social welfare administration, have received considerable acclaim as a means of enhancing human capital and reducing leakage of public resources through corruption. While numerous studies examine the effects of the program on human capital indicators in Mexico and various other countries that have adopted the approach, little is known about the effects of these programs on levels of corruption and on political life more generally. Using data from Transparency International Mexico, the Federal Register of Civil Society Organizations, and the national census, this paper analyzes whether conditional cash transfers have any bearing on corruption but also on two other aspects of political life argued to affect government probity in the long term: the density of civil society organizations and the empowerment of women as indicated by levels of active involvement in civil society. The conclusions are encouraging with respect to reducing corruption but rather dismal regarding the effects on civil society and the empowerment of women.},

abstract = {This paper is one in a series of World Bank Working Papers that seeks to document the experience of Brazil's Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia Program. It highlights the key “nuts and bolts” of designing and implementing the BFP in Brazil's decentralized context. Like other conditional cash transfers (CCTs), the BFP seeks to help (a) reduce current poverty and inequality, by providing a minimum level of income for extremely poor families; and (b) break the intergenerational transmission of poverty by conditioning these transfers on beneficiary compliance with human capital requirements (school attendance, vaccines, pre-natal visits). The program also seeks to help empower BFP beneficiaries by linking them to other complementary services. As the largest conditional cash transfer in the developing world, the BFP has attracted significant attention both in Brazil and beyond. As such, this paper has two key audiences – and two corresponding objectives. First, the primary audience is international, given world-wide interest in the Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia Program. This international target audience thus includes: policy makers, practitioners, and potential future practitioners of CCTs working in other countries who are interested in learning more abut Brazil's experience with the BFP, particularly given its decentralized context. For this audience, the paper highlights some of the key features of the program including: • The program as a reform program, which consolidated four pre-reform programs into one, building on Brazil's decade of experience with CCTs; • The size and rapid expansion of the program, now reaching 11.1 million families (over 46 million people), making it the largest program of this type in the world; • The very impressive targeting accuracy of the program, and the recently demonstrated impacts on reducing poverty and inequality; • The implementation of the BFP in Brazil's decentralized context and the development and use of innovative performance-based management mechanisms to promote incentives for quality implementation in this context so as to overcome the “principal-agent” dilemma; • The role of the BFP as a unifying force in social policy, integrating social policy both horizontally across sectors and vertically across levels of government; and • The “natural laboratory for innovation” that has emerged in Brazil's decentralized context, for experimenting with exit policies and graduation approaches. Second, the topic is clearly of interest to audiences in Brazil. As such, we seek to document the evolution of the design and implementation of the BFP under the first Lula Administration, taking stock of the main advances and highlighting key priorities for the future, including: • Priority actions for further strengthening of the “basic architecture” of the program: strengthening conditionalities monitoring, fine-tuning targeting, expanding coverage to reduce errors of exclusion, and enhancing oversight and controls; and • Possible innovations for the graduation agenda, including: (a) enhancing educational conditionalities (via bonuses for grade completion and graduation and incentives for older children to attend school); and (b) linking BFP beneficiaries to complementary services.},

We make use of recent developments in Bayesian model averaging to assess the effect of a large number of potential factors affecting democratisation processes and account for several specifications of spatial linkages. Our results indicate that spatial spillovers are present in the data even after controlling for a large number of geographical covariates. Addressing the determinants of democracy without modelling such spillovers may lead to flawed inference about the nature of the determinants of democratisation processes. In particular, our results emphasise the role played by Muslim religion, population size, trade volumes, English language, natural resource rents, GDP per capita, being a MENA country and the incidence of armed conflicts as factors affecting democracy robustly.},

We use microdata from ten countries to establish stylized facts on the magnitude, form, and distributional implications of this “informal taxation.” Informal taxation is widespread, particularly in rural areas, with substantial in-kind labor payments. The wealthy pay more, but pay less in percentage terms, and informal taxes are more regressive than formal taxes. Failing to include informal taxation underestimates household tax burdens and revenue decentralization in developing countries. We discuss various explanations for and implications of these observed stylized facts.(JEL H24, H27, O12, O17, O23)},

abstract = {Traditionally in the social sciences, causal mediation analysis has been formulated, understood, and implemented within the framework of linear structural equation models. We argue and demonstrate that this is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the framework to nonlinear models. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations. Our approach is general because it offers the definition, identification, estimation, and sensitivity analysis of causal mediation effects without reference to any specific statistical model. Further, our approach explicitly links these 4 elements closely together within a single framework. As a result, the proposed framework can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and nonparametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. The general definition and identification result also allow us to develop sensitivity analysis in the context of commonly used models, which enables applied researchers to formally assess the robustness of their empirical conclusions to violations of the key assumption. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Job Search Intervention Study. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all our proposed methods.},

@article{Rothstein2008,
abstract = {This essay explores the question of how formal institutions change. Despite the importance assigned by many scholars to the role of institutions in structuring political life, the issue of how these institutions are themselves shaped and reconfigured over time has not received the attention it is due. In the 1970s and 1980s, a good deal of comparative institutionalist work centered on comparative statics and was concerned with demonstrating the ways in which different institutional arrangements drove divergent political and policy outcomes (e.g., Katzenstein 1978). In addition, scholarship in the comparative historical tradition has yielded important insights into the genesis of divergent (usually national) trajectories. Works in this vein include some classics such as Gerschenkron (1962), Moore (1966), and Shefter (1977), but also significant recent contributions such as Collier and Collier (1991), Skocpol (1992), Spruyt (1994), Ertman (1997), Gould (1999), and Huber and Stephens (2001). Finally, we have a number of analyses that address the issue of “feedback mechanisms” that are responsible for the reproduction of various institutional and policy trajectories over time (e.g., Pierson 1993; Skocpol 1992; Weir 1992b). Ongoing theoretical work centering on the concept of path dependence by Mahoney, Pierson, and others has lent greater precision to previous formulations based on the dual notions of “critical junctures” and “historical trajectories” (Mahoney 2000; Pierson 2000a). As these authors have shown, some of the major works in comparative historical analysis can be read as illustrations of path dependence in social and political development.},

abstract = {Bangladesh is dominated by a small-holder agrarian economy under extreme stress. Production shortfalls, increasing economic polarization, and chronic malnutrition are persistent, but major famine has been diverted in part by significant growth in agriculture. This recent history is open to both Malthusian and Boserupian interpretations-a history we explore here through a test of the induced intensification thesis of agricultural change. This thesis, framed by variations in the behavior of small-holders, has grown from a simple demand-production relationship to a consideration of the mediating influences on that relationship. The induced intensification thesis is reviewed and tested for 265 households in 6 villages in Bangladesh from 1950-1986. A time-series analysis of an induced intensification model provides relatively high levels of explained variance in cropping intensity (frequency and land productivity) and also indicates the relative impacts of household class, environment, and cropping strategies. On average, the small-holders in question kept pace with the demands on production, although important class and village variations were evident and the proportion of landless households increased. These results, coupled with evidence that agricultural growth involved intensification thresholds, provide clues about Malthusian and Boserupian interpretations of Bangladesh, and suggest that small-holder agriculture there is likely to continue on a "muted" path of growth.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the randomized controlled trial (RCT) is widely considered the most reliable method for evaluation of health care interventions, challenges to both internal and external validity exist. Thus, the efficacy of an intervention in a trial setting does not necessarily represent the real-world performance that decision makers seek to inform comparative effectiveness studies and economic evaluations. METHODS: Using data from the ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study (ALTS), we performed a simplified economic evaluation of age-based management strategies to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) among women who were referred to the study with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL). We used data from the trial itself to adjust for 1) potential lead time bias and random error that led to variation in the observed prevalence of CIN3 by study arm and 2) potential ascertainment bias among providers in the most aggressive management arm. RESULTS: We found that using unadjusted RCT data may result in counterintuitive cost-effectiveness results when random error and/or bias are present. Following adjustment, the rank order of management strategies changed for 2 of the 3 age groups we considered. CONCLUSIONS: D ecision analysts need to examine STUDY DESIGN: , available trial data, and cost-effectiveness results closely in order to detect evidence of potential bias. Adjustment for random error and bias in RCTs may yield different policy conclusions relative to unadjusted trial data.},

The paper develops a simple dynamic model in which new suburban and older central-city properties compete for mobile residents. The level of housing services generated by older properties depends on current maintenance or reinvestment expenditures. In this setting, market failures that reduce the cost of occupying suburban locations, thus leading to excessive suburban development, also depress central-city housing prices and undermine maintenance incentives, leading to deficient levels of central-city reinvestment. Corrective policies that shift population from the suburbs to the center result in higher levels of reinvestment in central-city housing, therefore reducing blight.},

abstract = {There is a very large literature examining income inequality in relation to health. Early reviews came to different interpretations of the evidence, though a large majority of studies reported that health tended to be worse in more unequal societies. More recent studies, not included in those reviews, provide substantial new evidence. Our purpose in this paper is to assess whether or not wider income differences play a causal role leading to worse health. We conducted a literature review within an epidemiological causal framework and inferred the likelihood of a causal relationship between income inequality and health (including violence) by considering the evidence as a whole. The body of evidence strongly suggests that income inequality affects population health and wellbeing. The major causal criteria of temporality, biological plausibility, consistency and lack of alternative explanations are well supported. Of the small minority of studies which find no association, most can be explained by income inequality being measured at an inappropriate scale, the inclusion of mediating variables as controls, the use of subjective rather than objective measures of health, or follow up periods which are too short.The evidence that large income differences have damaging health and social consequences is strong and in most countries inequality is increasing. Narrowing the gap will improve the health and wellbeing of populations.},

abstract = {Can formal democratic institutions succeed if they are built in societies with inhospitable social and economic conditions? In particular, will attempts to hold competitive elections fail to strengthen democracy in poor and divided nation states, as well as in regions such as the Middle East which are dominated by autocracy? Skeptics point to an earlier wave of institution building, when European-style parliaments were transplanted to many African societies during the era of decolonization, including in Benin and Togo, only to collapse as the military usurped their powers.1 We first need to establish the influence of certain underlying economic and social conditions on democratic consolidation before proceeding to examine the impact of power- sharing institutions in subsequent chapters. As Dahl points out, where the underlying conditions are highly unfavorable, then it is improbable that democracy could be preserved by any constitutional design. By contrast, if the underlying conditions are highly favorable, then democratic consolidation is likely with almost any constitution.2 But many cases fall into the muddy middle-ground. The analysis of cross-sectional time-series data illuminates the general patterns and what conditions count, focusing upon examining the role of wealth, the size of nation states, colonial legacies, regional diffusion, and the degree of ethnic heterogeneity. Each of these factors can be regarded as ‘structural' constraints on political development, meaning that it is difficult for domestic policymakers or the international community to alter these conditions in the medium to short-term, if at all; for example countries cannot change their histories or chose their neighboring states, although they can attempt to grow their economy. The East Asian cases of South Korea and Singapore provide further insights into how certain structural factors facilitate, but do not determine, democratic consolidation. Both Asian societies have experienced rapidly economic transformation in recent decades, yet South Korea has adopted multiparty elections and strengthened human rights, with the regimes rated by Freedom House as equivalent to Greece or Israel, while Singapore is rated only ‘partly free' by Freedom House. The contrasts help to explain the strengths – and limits – of socioeconomic explanations of democratization.},

abstract = {What is the profile of candidates whose electoral campaigns are the most dependent on corporate donations? Our main objective is to identify factors that help explaining the level of corporate dependence among them. We answer this question in relation to the 2010 elections for federal deputy in Brazil. We test five hypotheses: 01. right-wing party candidates are more dependent than their counterparts on the left; 02. government coalition candidates are more dependent than candidates from the opposition; 03. incumbents are more dependent on corporate donations than challengers; 04. businesspeople running as candidates receive more corporate donations than other candidates; and 05. male candidates are more dependent than female candidates. Methodologically, the research design combines both descriptive and multivariate statistics. We use OLS regression, cluster analysis and the Tobit model. The results show support for hypotheses 01, 03 and 04. There is no empirical support for hypothesis 05. Finally, hypothesis 02 was not only rejected, but we find evidence that candidates from the opposition receive more contributions from the corporate sector.},

In the former case, partisan networks mediate access to goods. In the latter, beneficiaries are defined by policy and access is independent from partisan distribution networks. We show that these different access mechanisms shape voters' distributive expectations and the nature of their linkages to political parties by developing a unique methodology to measure party networks. We test it using original survey data from Argentina and Chile and show variation both across and within countries on party–voter linkages based on differential access to benefits and parties' organizational capacity.},

abstract = { Existing theories relating patterns of pedestrian and vehicular movement to urban form characterise the problem in terms of flows to and from ‘attractor' land uses. This paper contains evidence in support of a new ‘configurational' paradigm in which a primary property of the form of the urban grid is to privilege certain spaces over others for through movement. In this way it is suggested that the configuration of the urban grid itself is the main generator of patterns of movement. Retail land uses are then located to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the passing trade and may well act as multipliers on the basic pattern of ‘natural movement' generated by the grid configuration. The configurational correlates of movement patterns are found to be measures of global properties of the grid with the ‘space syntax' measure of ‘integration' consistently found to be the most important. This has clear implications for urban design suggesting that if we wish to design for well used urban space, then it is not the local properties of a space that are important in the main but its configurational relations to the larger urban system. },

abstract = {In a recent article published in the Latin American Research Review, Si- mone Bohn analyzed electoral results and survey data from Brazil to contest several theses concerning the reelection of President Luiz In{\'{a}}cio Lula da Silva in 2006. In par- ticular, Bohn asserted that benefi ciaries of Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia, a conditional cash transfer program that was reaching eleven million families at the time of the 2006 election, were already supporters of Lula in 2002, and therefore the program could not have contrib- uted to the change in Lula's constituency between his election in 2002 and his reelection in 2006. We show that these claims are based on voter recall data collected between nine and fi fty-seven months after the elections, and that these data grossly overestimate actual electoral support for Lula—probably as a result of well-known reporting biases. Reanalysis of Bohn's data as well as analysis of more reliable surveys suggest that there were indeed signifi cant changes in voting patterns between 2002 and 2006, and that Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia did play an important role in the 2006 elections.

Comparing the dynamics of decentralization across two areas of health policy, AIDS and tuberculosis, this article presents one strategy utilized by federal bureaucrats to increase their regulatory capacity: seeking resources located outside the formal political arena. Specifically, national bureaucrats utilize international resources tomobilize local civic groups as policy watchdogs, thus increasing the accountability of subnational politicians both to the center and to the public.},

It has a social objective of making the commercial activity, a productive development and welfare activity. In areas where local production was sufficient for local consumption, dependence on public distribution was resorted to in the periods of shortage. The PDS aims in providing fair distribution and self sufficiency in good grains to the public.

abstract = {Residential communities are the basic living units in Chinese cities. Housing prices are closely associated with the community location and surrounding support facilities. When selecting satisfactory residential accommodation, potential real estate purchasers prioritize the community location in a city at the macro-level and then consider other micro-factors (i.e., the floor, orientation, structure, etc.). This paper attempts to explore the relationship between housing prices and locational factors at the community level. We collect the current market prices of 545 residential communities built in the last decade in Ningbo, the second largest city in Zhejiang Province. Then, thirteen locational factors of five dimensions are identified to research their influences on housing prices. In the process of selecting certain locational variables, both extant features and additional features (i.e., planned ones) are considered. The geographic field model is introduced to quantify the external effects of locational factors, due to its advantages of producing more accurate results than that of traditional distance-based measure methods. Then, regression analysis is performed based on the average housing prices of residential communities and explanatory variables by the ordinary least squares model and the geographically weighted regression. The regression coefficients demonstrate that the externalities of parks, lakes, department stores, banks, secondary schools and rail transit have significant but spatially non-stationary effects on housing prices. The results provide references for local real estate planning departments and potential real estate purchasers.},

abstract = {This article explores the puzzle of why Mexico's long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) implemented a series of electoral reforms in 1996 that precipitated its own downfall. Previous work explaining the process of Mexican democratization focuses on foreign pressures, interparty bargaining and a unified PRI. Alternatively, we argue that internal divisions in the PRI-conjoined with the threat of a presidential deal with the opposition-determined the particular shape of the reform. The article uses a bargaining model to illustrate the conjunction of interests between the President and PRI hard-liners while taking into account the shadow role played by the opposition. We argue, finally, that the model can be extended to aid explanations of other democratic transitions, as well as general cases of majority-party decision-making and coalition bargaining.},

This hypothesis has not been consistently{\$}\backslash{\$}nsupported by empirical studies; however, previous methods used to{\$}\backslash{\$}nstudy this hypothesis have confounded assignment method with other{\$}\backslash{\$}nstudy features. To avoid these confounding factors, this study randomly{\$}\backslash{\$}nassigned participants to be in a randomized experiment or a nonrandomized{\$}\backslash{\$}nexperiment. In the randomized experiment, participants were randomly{\$}\backslash{\$}nassigned to mathematics or vocabulary training; in the nonrandomized{\$}\backslash{\$}nexperiment, participants chose their training.

abstract = {Prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer in males in Western countries. The reported incidence in Asian countries is much lower than that in African Americans and European Caucasians. Although the lack of systematic prostate cancer screening system in Asian countries explains part of the difference, this alone cannot fully explain the lower incidence in Asian immigrants in the United States and west-European countries compared to the black and non-Hispanic white in those countries, nor the somewhat better prognosis in Asian immigrants with prostate cancer in the United States. Soy food consumption, more popular in Asian populations, is associated with a 25{\$}\backslash{\$}{\%} to 30{\$}\backslash{\$}{\%} reduced risk of prostate cancer. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the only established and routinely implemented clinical biomarker for prostate cancer detection and disease status. Other biomarkers, such as urinary prostate cancer antigen 3 RNA, may increase accuracy of prostate cancer screening compared to PSA alone. Several susceptible loci have been identified in genetic linkage analyses in populations of countries in the West, and approximately 30 genetic polymorphisms have been reported to modestly increase the prostate cancer risk in genome-wide association studies. Most of the identified polymorphisms are reproducible regardless of ethnicity. Somatic mutations in the genomes of prostate tumors have been repeatedly reported to include deletion and gain of the 8p and 8q chromosomal regions, respectively; epigenetic gene silencing of glutathione S-transferase Pi (GSTP1); as well as mutations in androgen receptor gene. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis, aggressiveness, and prognosis of prostate cancer remain largely unknown. Gene-gene and/or gene-environment interactions still need to be learned. In this review, the differences in PSA screening practice, reported incidence and prognosis of prostate cancer, and genetic factors between the populations in East and West factors are discussed.},

abstract = {Engineering tools and mathematical optimization are applied in this study to plan the work of the agents of the cow artificial insemination service (inseminator) in Israel. Time is crucial in insemination as the chances of conception decline with increasing delay between the start of estrus and insemination. About 1,090 artificial inseminations of cows are performed daily in Israel. They involve 412 farms in 283 villages, and are performed by 29 inseminators; the work plan should balance the work load among the inseminators. To this end, the working time of an inseminator in each village is required. Thus, a model to predict the working time in a village was developed. Subsequently, a mathematical optimization model was designed and solved, which aims to allocate customers to trips and to determine the itinerary of each trip to minimize total distance/time. The main benefits included a 21.4{\$}\backslash{\$}{\%} reduction in total traveling time and a 55{\$}\backslash{\$}{\%} reduction in the difference between the lengths of the longest and shortest working days. Moreover, the longest delay in reaching an estrous cow is reduced from 7.6 to 5.9 h (i.e., by 1.7 h), which may increase the conception ratio by some 7{\$}\backslash{\$}{\%}. In addition, the trade-off between work balance and total traveling time was studied.},

To this end, the working time of an inseminator in each village is required. Thus, a model to predict the working time in a village was developed. Subsequently, a mathematical optimization model was designed and solved, which aims to allocate customers to trips and to determine the itinerary of each trip to minimize total distance/time. The main benefits included a 21.4{\$}\backslash{\$}{\%} reduction in total traveling time and a 55{\$}\backslash{\$}{\%} reduction in the difference between the lengths of the longest and shortest working days. Moreover, the longest delay in reaching an estrous cow is reduced from 7.6 to 5.9 h (i.e., by 1.7 h), which may increase the conception ratio by some 7{\$}\backslash{\$}{\%}. In addition, the trade-off between work balance and total traveling time was studied.},

abstract = {We show that contemporary differences in political attitudes across counties in the American South trace their origins to slavery's prevalence more than 150 years ago. Whites who currently live in Southern counties that had high shares of slaves in 1860 are more likely to identify as a Republican, oppose affirmative action policies, and express racial resentment and colder feelings toward blacks. These results cannot be explained by existing theories, including the theory of racial threat. To explain these results, we offer evidence for a new theory involving the historical persistence of racial attitudes. We argue that, following the Civil War, Southern whites faced political and economic incentives to reinforce racist norms and institutions. This produced racially conservative political attitudes, which in turn have been passed down locally across generations. Our results challenge the interpretation of a vast literature on racial attitudes in the American South. },

What similarities and differences exist between the development experiences of Cear{\'{a}} and the Indian state of Kerala? Under what circumstances might cross-state [or cross-province] comparisons yield even more reliable and useful development lessons than cross-national or cross-regional comparisons? McGuire set these questions against a larger set of contrasts and issues posed with respect to the workshop topic of rethinking the interpretations of the development experience in East Asia and Latin America, and its relevance to the thinking about human development. To sum it up crudely, McGuire's rendition of the now-familiar current thinking about the East-Asia/Latin-America contrast (henceforth EA vs. LA) portrays East Asian successes in poverty-reducing and},

A conventional model of social learning is found to fit some types of changes in policy well but not the movement from Keynesian to monetarist modes of policymaking. In cases of paradigm shift, policy responds to a wider social debate bound up with electoral competition that demands a reformulation of traditional conceptions of state-society relations.},

abstract = {Does democracy affect the provision of basic services? We advance on existing empirical work on this subject by exploring the potential mechanisms through which a democratic transition may prompt a government to alter provision of basic services to its citizens. In an environment of weak state capacity, in which it is difficult for voters to attribute outcomes to executive actions, we suggest that electoral competition is most likely to lead to changes in policies where executive action is verifiable. Considering the context of African primary education as an example, we suggest that electoral competition will therefore give governments an incentive to abolish school fees, but it will have less effect on the provision of school inputs, precisely because executive actions on these issues are more difficult to monitor. We evaluate this claim by approaching it in three different ways, using cross-national as well as individual-level data, including an original data set on primary school fee abolitions. First we show that in Africa, democracies have higher rates of school attendance than nondemocracies. Moreover, evidence suggests that this is primarily due to the fact that democracies are more likely to abolish school fees, not to the fact that they provide more inputs. We then estimate the likelihood that a government will abolish school fees subsequent to an election, taking account of endogeneity concerns involving election timing. Finally, we use survey data from Kenya to provide evidence suggesting that citizens condition their voting intentions on an outcome that a politician can control directly, in this case abolishing school fees, but not on outcomes over which politicians have much more indirect influence, such as local school quality},

@article{Mahoney1999,
abstract = {The oscillation of the study of political regime change between voluntarist and structural approaches has increasingly led scholars to seek research strategies for synthesizing the two approaches. This article addresses the conceptual and practical difficulties of achieving such a synthesis by evaluating several strategies for integrating voluntarist and structural factors in the analysis of regime change. It examines competing ways of conceptualizing agency and structure and assesses the varied consequences that different conceptualizations have for explaining regime transformation. The article also analyzes three distinct strategies for integrating agency and structure: the funnel, path-dependent, and eclectic strategies. Each integrative strategy isanchored by a different conceptual base and has characteristic strengths and limitations. The conclusion explores future directions for developing integrative strategies.},

abstract = {I study how a revolutionary vanguard might use violence to mobilize a mass public. The mechanism is informational—the vanguard uses violence to manipulate population member's beliefs about the level of antigovernment sentiment in society. The model has multiple equilibria, one equilibrium in which there may be revolution and another in which there is certain not to be. In the former, structural factors influence expected mobilization, whereas in the latter they do not. Hence, the model is consistent with structural factors influencing the likelihood of revolution in some societies but not others, offering a partial defense of structural accounts from common critiques. The model also challenges standard arguments about the role of revolutionary vanguards. The model is consistent with vanguard violence facilitating mobilization and even sparking spontaneous uprisings. However, it also predicts selection effects—an active vanguard emerges only in societies that are already coordinated on a participatory equilibrium. Hence, a correlation between vanguard activity and mass mobilization may not constitute evidence for the causal efficacy of vanguards—be it through creating focal points, providing selective incentives, or communicating information.},

@article{Imai2016a,
abstract = {A vast literature demonstrates that voters around the world who benefit from their governments' discretionary spending cast ballots for the incumbent party in larger proportions than those not receiving funds. But contrary to most theories of politi- cal accountability, the evidence seems to indicate that voters also reward incumbent parties for implementing “programmatic” spending legislation, passed with support from all major parties, and over which incumbents have no discretion. Why voters would attribute responsibility when none exists is unclear, as is why minority party legislators would approve of legislation that will cost them votes. We address this puzzle with one of the largest randomized social experiments ever, resulting in clear rejection of the claim that programmatic policies greatly increase voter support for incumbents. We also reanalyze the study cited as claiming the strongest support for the electoral effects of programmatic policies, which is also a very large scale ran- domized experiment. We show that its key results vanish after correcting either a simple coding error affecting only two observations or highly unconventional data analysis procedures (or both). We also discuss how these consistent empirical results from the only two probative experiments on this question may be reconciled with several observational and theoretical studies touching on similar questions in other contexts.},

And about 34 percent of Aboriginal women will not reach that same early middle age. In the heartland of the country, there is a genuine emergency that warrants the most urgent response. Syndrome X the doctors call it. It is a modern plague of chronic illness that is scything through several generations of Australian citizens. The author questions why government and media aren't marshalling a determined nation-wide response to Australia and its problems. He relates how Syndrome X could possibly be the result of many decades of neglect, lack of education and inequity. It is the diseases of poverty like scabies that make this epidemic of so-called lifestyle illnesses so much worse for Indigenous people.},

abstract = {Brazil is a large complex country that is undergoing rapid economic, social, and environmental change. In this Series of six articles, we have reported important improvements in health status and life expectancy, which can be ascribed largely to progress in social determinants of health and to implementation of a comprehensive national health system with strong social participation. Many challenges remain, however. Socioeconomic and regional disparities are still unacceptably large, reflecting the fact that much progress is still needed to improve basic living conditions for a large proportion of the population. New health problems arise as a result of urbanisation and social and environmental change, and some old health issues remain unabated. Administration of a complex, decentralised public-health system, in which a large share of services is contracted out to the private sector, together with many private insurance providers, inevitably causes conflict and contradiction. The challenge is ultimately political, and we conclude with a call for action that requires continuous engagement by Brazilian society as a whole in securing the right to health for all Brazilian people.},

Although governance in multilevel settings has become a prominent research field in political science, there are few comparative studies that focus on explaining sub-national coalition outcomes in such settings. This paper sets out to study regional government formation in eight European countries and it builds on a dataset that covers information on the policy preferences of parties drawn from regional election manifestos. The results show that parties at the regional level are likely to form congruent coalitions, that is, 'copying' the patterns of national government formation, and that they are more likely to do so in specific regional contexts. {\textcopyright}2013 Copyright Regional Studies Association.},

abstract = {What makes African voters 'up for grabs'? Existing approaches to the swing voter have several liabilities. This article introduces a new measure enabling a more comprehensive assessment of swing voting, including the differentiation between clientelistic and collective goods motivations. The issue of swing voting is then brought to an environment where voters are rarely considered persuadable: Africa. Using a count-model estimation technique and original survey data from Ghana's critical 2008 elections, the analysis challenges the near consensus in African politics on clientelism as the only electoral strategy. When voters perceive politicians as providing collective, developmental goods, the efficacy of clientelism as a tool to win over voters is reduced. Many persuadable voters can also be won over by both clientelistic and collective goods, thus contradicting the literature presenting these as mutually exclusive. Finally, the analysis shows that incumbents do better when they provide collective goods even in highly clientelistic environments. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {What makes political regimes rise, endure, and fall? The main question is whether the observed close relation between levels of economic development and the incidence of democratic regimes is due to democracies being more likely to emerge or only more likely to survive in the more developed countries. We answer this question using data concerning 135 countries that existed at any time between 1950 and 1990. We find that the level of economic development does not affect the probability of transitions to democracy but that affluence does make democratic regimes more stable. The relation between affluence and democratic stability is monotonic, and the breakdown of democracies at middle levels of development is a phenomenon peculiar to the Southern Cone of Latin America. These patterns also appear to have been true of the earlier period, but dictatorships are more likely to survive in wealthy countries that became independent only after 1950. We conclude that modernization need not generate democracy but democracies survive in countries that are modern.},

abstract = {In the past three decades, Brazil has undergone rapid changes in major social determinants of health and in the organisation of health services. In this report, we examine how these changes have affected indicators of maternal health, child health, and child nutrition. We use data from vital statistics, population censuses, demographic and health surveys, and published reports. In the past three decades, infant mortality rates have reduced substantially, decreasing by 5{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} a year in the 1980s and 1990s, and by 4{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} a year since 2000 to reach 20 deaths per 1000 livebirths in 2008. Neonatal deaths account for 68{\%} of infant deaths. Stunting prevalence among children younger than 5 years decreased from 37{\%} in 1974-75 to 7{\%} in 2006-07. Regional differences in stunting and child mortality also decreased. Access to most maternal-health and child-health interventions increased sharply to almost universal coverage, and regional and socioeconomic inequalities in access to such interventions were notably reduced. The median duration of breastfeeding increased from 2{\textperiodcentered}5 months in the 1970s to 14 months by 2006-07. Official statistics show stable maternal mortality ratios during the past 10 years, but modelled data indicate a yearly decrease of 4{\%}, a trend which might not have been noticeable in official reports because of improvements in death registration and the increased number of investigations into deaths of women of reproductive age. The reasons behind Brazil's progress include: socioeconomic and demographic changes (economic growth, reduction in income disparities between the poorest and wealthiest populations, urbanisation, improved education of women, and decreased fertility rates), interventions outside the health sector (a conditional cash transfer programme and improvements in water and sanitation), vertical health programmes in the 1980s (promotion of breastfeeding, oral rehydration, and immunisations), creation of a tax-funded national health service in 1988 (coverage of which expanded to reach the poorest areas of the country through the Family Health Program in the mid-1990s); and implementation of many national and state-wide programmes to improve child health and child nutrition and, to a lesser extent, to promote women's health. Nevertheless, substantial challenges remain, including overmedicalisation of childbirth (nearly 50{\%} of babies are delivered by caesarean section), maternal deaths caused by illegal abortions, and a high frequency of preterm deliveries.},

@article{Bossert1998,
abstract = {Decentralization has long been advocated as a desirable process for improving health systems. Nevertheless, we still lack a sufficient analytical framework for systematically studying how decentralization can achieve this objective. We do not have adequate means of analyzing the three key elements of decentralization: (1) the amount of choice that is transferred from central institutions to institutions at the periphery of health systems, (2) what choices local officials make with their increased discretion and (3) what effect these choices have on the performance of the health system. This article proposes a framework of analysis that can be used to design and evaluate the decentralization of health systems. It starts from the assumption that decentralization is not an end in itself but rather should be designed and evaluated for its ability to achieve broader objectives of health reform: equity, efficiency, quality and financial soundness. Using a "principal agent" approach as the basic framework, but incorporating insights from public administration, local public choice and social capital approaches, the article presents a decision space approach which defines decentralization in terms of the set of functions and degrees of choice that formally are transferred to local officials. The approach also evaluates the incentives that central government can offer to local decision-makers to encourage them to achieve health objectives. It evaluates the local government characteristics that also influence decision-making and implementation at the local level. Then it determines whether local officials innovate by making choices that are different from those directed by central authorities. Finally, it evaluates whether the local choices have improved the performance of the local health system in achieving the broader health objectives. Examples from Colombia are used to illustrate the approach. The framework will be used to analyze the experience of decentralization in a series of empirical studies in Latin America. The results of these studies should suggest policy recommendations for adjusting decision space and incentives so that localities make decisions that achieve the objectives of health reform.},

abstract = {Conditional cash transfer programs, an innovation in social welfare administration, have received considerable acclaim as a means of enhancing human capital and reducing leakage of public resources through corruption. While numerous studies examine the effects of the program on human capital indicators in Mexico and various other countries that have adopted the approach, little is known about the effects of these programs on levels of corruption and on political life more generally. Using data from Transparency International Mexico, the Federal Register of Civil Society Organizations, and the national census, this paper analyzes whether conditional cash transfers have any bearing on corruption but also on two other aspects of political life argued to affect government probity in the long term: the density of civil society organizations and the empowerment of women as indicated by levels of active involvement in civil society. The conclusions are encouraging with respect to reducing corruption but rather dismal regarding the effects on civil society and the empowerment of women.},

abstract = {Brazil is a country of continental dimensions with widespread regional and social inequalities. In this report, we examine the historical development and components of the Brazilian health system, focusing on the reform process during the past 40 years, including the creation of the Unified Health System. A defining characteristic of the contemporary health sector reform in Brazil is that it was driven by civil society rather than by governments, political parties, or international organisations. The advent of the Unified Health System increased access to health care for a substantial proportion of the Brazilian population, at a time when the system was becoming increasingly privatised. Much is still to be done if universal health care is to be achieved. Over the past 20 years, there have been other advances, including investments in human resources, science and technology, and primary care, and a substantial decentralisation process, widespread social participation, and growing public awareness of a right to health care. If the Brazilian health system is to overcome the challenges with which it is presently faced, strengthened political support is needed so that financing can be restructured and the roles of both the public and private sector can be redefined.},

abstract = {This article estimates the electoral effects of conditional cash transfers (CCTs) in three presidential elections in Brazil. It analyzes municipal-level electoral results and survey data and employs matching techniques to reduce causal inference problems typical of observational studies. Results show that CCTs are associated with increased performance by the incumbent party presidential candidate in all three elections but that these effects have been reaped by incumbents from different parties. It also shows that CCTs have had no discernible impacts on party identification and the performance of incumbent parties in legislative elections. Together, these findings suggest that CCTs are significant in the short run, but lack the capacity to induce substantial long-termvoter realignments.},

These choices are conditioned by existing organizational endowments, the costs of buying support, and the trade-off between the cost and probability of exit from office. In turn, both rent distribution and competition result in distinct configurations of state capture: clientelism, predation, fusion, exploitation, and the formation of specific state institutions and capacities.},

abstract = {Within the past several years, a considerable body of research on social capital has emerged in public health.{\$}\backslash{\$}nAlthough offering the potential for new insights into how community factors impact health and well being, this research{\$}\backslash{\$}nhas received criticism for being undertheorized and methodologically ﬂawed. In an effort to address some of these{\$}\backslash{\$}nlimitations, this paper applies Pierre Bourdieu's (1986) [Bourdieu, P. (1986). Handbook of theory and research for the{\$}\backslash{\$}nsociology of education (pp. 241–258). New York: Greenwood] social capital theory to create a conceptual model of{\$}\backslash{\$}nneighborhood socioeconomic processes, social capital (resources inhered within social networks), and health. After{\$}\backslash{\$}nbrieﬂy reviewing the social capital conceptualizations of Bourdieu and Putnam, I attempt to integrate these authors'{\$}\backslash{\$}ntheories to better understand how social capital might operate within neighborhoods or local areas. Next, I describe a{\$}\backslash{\$}nconceptual model that incorporates this theoretical integration of social capital into a framework of neighborhood{\$}\backslash{\$}nsocial processes as health determinants. Discussion focuses on the utility of this Bourdieu-based neighborhood social{\$}\backslash{\$}ncapital theory and model for examining several under-addressed issues of social capital in the neighborhood effects{\$}\backslash{\$}nliterature and generating speciﬁc, empirically testable hypotheses for future research.{\$}\backslash{\$}nr 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Este livro tem o objetivo de aprofundar o debate sobre o Estado e desenvolvimento no limiar do s{\'{e}}culo XXI por meio da an{\'{a}}lise das capacidades estatais de implementa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de pol{\'{i}}ticas p{\'{u}}blicas no Brasil democr{\'{a}}tico. O momento hist{\'{o}}rico atual marca um encontro entre uma postura ativa do Estado brasileiro e a vig{\^{e}}ncia de institui{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es democr{\'{a}}ticas estabelecidas pela Constitui{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o Federal de 1988. Este encontro suscita um conjunto de quest{\~{o}}es, entre elas a capacidade do Poder Executivo de implementar suas pol{\'{i}}ticas envolvendo m{\'{u}}ltiplos atores e interesses, sem violar os direitos e as institui{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es garantidas por um regime democr{\'{a}}tico e pluralista. Isso demanda novas capacidades do Estado, que v{\~{a}}o al{\'{e}}m das necessidades de uma burocracia profissional e aut{\^{o}}noma, que possa tra{\c{c}}ar estrat{\'{e}}gias com os atores privados sem ser capturada. Ou seja, mais que as capacidades t{\'{e}}cnicas e administrativas exigidas de uma burocracia weberiana cl{\'{a}}ssica. Este livro apresenta a tese de que, no contexto democr{\'{a}}tico atual, caracterizado pela exist{\^{e}}ncia e o funcionamento de institui{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es representativas, participativas e de controles burocr{\'{a}}ticos, s{\~{a}}o necess{\'{a}}rias tamb{\'{e}}m capacidades pol{\'{i}}ticas dos agentes do Estado para a produ{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de pol{\'{i}}ticas p{\'{u}}blicas. No debate da literatura sobre o tema, encontram-se desde posi{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es que advogam pela sinergia existente entre democracia e pol{\'{i}}ticas de car{\'{a}}ter desenvolvimentista, ressaltando a qualidade e legitimidade de decis{\~{o}}es compartilhadas, at{\'{e}} argumentos que enfatizam os conflitos e obst{\'{a}}culos aos processos de desenvolvimento acelerado decorrentes da incorpora{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de amplo conjunto de interesses nos processos decis{\'{o}}rios, com a multiplica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o dos pontos de veto. As institui{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es democr{\'{a}}ticas imp{\~{o}}em restri{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es {\`{a}} implementa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de pol{\'{i}}ticas p{\'{u}}blicas, gerando inefici{\^{e}}ncias e impasses? Como conciliar as distintas dimens{\~{o}}es do desenvolvimento – econ{\^{o}}mica, social, pol{\'{i}}tica, ambiental –, respeitando-se os m{\'{u}}ltiplos interesses dos atores que comp{\~{o}}em a sociedade? Para responder a tais quest{\~{o}}es, o Ipea realizou, por meio da colabora{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o entre pesquisadores do instituto e docentes de universidades brasileiras e estrangeiras, projeto de pesquisa que deu origem a este livro. A pesquisa teve como objetivo analisar em profundidade os arranjos institucionais de pol{\'{i}}ticas p{\'{u}}blicas representativas dos atuais esfor{\c{c}}os do governo em promover o desenvolvimento. Por arranjos institucionais, definiu-se o conjunto de regras, mecanismos e processos que definem a forma particular como se coordenam atores e interesses na implementa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de cada pol{\'{i}}tica. No decorrer da pesquisa foram desenvolvidos novos conceitos e modelos anal{\'{i}}ticos, apresentados neste volume, que permitiram compreender a opera{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de atores no interior do Estado e como as institui{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es democr{\'{a}}ticas se fazem presentes nos casos estudados, extraindo-se infer{\^{e}}ncias e proposi{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es pass{\'{i}}veis de serem utilizadas para an{\'{a}}lise de outros casos. Os achados indicam que o aventado trade-off entre a a{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do Estado e institui{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es democr{\'{a}}ticas {\'{e}} menos prevalente do que se imaginava. Os casos estudados demonstraram que a condu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de pol{\'{i}}ticas de desenvolvimento em ambiente democr{\'{a}}tico imp{\~{o}}e – isso sim – novas capacidades por parte das burocracias p{\'{u}}blicas, tanto no que se refere {\`{a}}s habilidades t{\'{e}}cnicas de formula{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o quanto no que concerne {\`{a}}s compet{\^{e}}ncias pol{\'{i}}ticas de implementa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o. Espera-se que este material possa contribuir para a {\'{a}}rea de conhecimento sobre pol{\'{i}}ticas p{\'{u}}blicas, fornecendo elementos n{\~{a}}o s{\'{o}} para um programa de pesquisa sobre capacidades estatais e democracia, mas tamb{\'{e}}m para a{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o p{\'{u}}blica de qualidade neste Brasil de limiar de s{\'{e}}culo.},

abstract = {Although fiscal policies of central governments sometimes provide modest insurance against regional income shocks, this paper shows that procyclical fiscal policy among provincial governments can easily overwhelm these stabilizing effects. We examine the cyclicality of budget items among provincial governments in seven federations, showing that own-source taxes are generally highly procyclical, and contrary to common wisdom, revenue sharing, and discretionary transfers are either acyclical or procyclical. Constituent governments are thus left alone to smooth their own shocks, and we document the extent to which various restraints on borrowing and saving undermine their ability to do so. The resulting procyclicality of provincial fiscal policy is likely to have important implications in a world where demands for countercyclical fiscal policy are increasing but considerable fiscal responsibilities are being devolved to subnational governments.},

abstract = {Can formal democratic institutions succeed if they are built in societies with inhospitable social and economic conditions? In particular, will attempts to hold competitive elections fail to strengthen democracy in poor and divided nation states, as well as in regions such as the Middle East which are dominated by autocracy? Skeptics point to an earlier wave of institution building, when European-style parliaments were transplanted to many African societies during the era of decolonization, including in Benin and Togo, only to collapse as the military usurped their powers.1 We first need to establish the influence of certain underlying economic and social conditions on democratic consolidation before proceeding to examine the impact of power- sharing institutions in subsequent chapters. As Dahl points out, where the underlying conditions are highly unfavorable, then it is improbable that democracy could be preserved by any constitutional design. By contrast, if the underlying conditions are highly favorable, then democratic consolidation is likely with almost any constitution.2 But many cases fall into the muddy middle-ground. The analysis of cross-sectional time-series data illuminates the general patterns and what conditions count, focusing upon examining the role of wealth, the size of nation states, colonial legacies, regional diffusion, and the degree of ethnic heterogeneity. Each of these factors can be regarded as ‘structural' constraints on political development, meaning that it is difficult for domestic policymakers or the international community to alter these conditions in the medium to short-term, if at all; for example countries cannot change their histories or chose their neighboring states, although they can attempt to grow their economy. The East Asian cases of South Korea and Singapore provide further insights into how certain structural factors facilitate, but do not determine, democratic consolidation. Both Asian societies have experienced rapidly economic transformation in recent decades, yet South Korea has adopted multiparty elections and strengthened human rights, with the regimes rated by Freedom House as equivalent to Greece or Israel, while Singapore is rated only ‘partly free' by Freedom House. The contrasts help to explain the strengths – and limits – of socioeconomic explanations of democratization.},

And yet, the question of whether polycentrism helps or hinders disease control/mitigation, or service provision more generally, has not been sufficiently studied. This article details findings from an exploratory case study of the polycentric governance of infectious disease in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Combining analyses of an original survey of local councilors, structured interviews with relevant actors in four municipalities, and a national survey of South African citizens, the study finds a high degree of polycentric governance, and highlights associated accountability gaps and a series of constraints on effective service delivery. It concludes by identifying promising directions for future research.},

To facilitate research on vote buying in the Americas, the 2010 AmericasBarometer survey included two questions on this topic. In this Insights report, we present a preliminary look at the first of these questions, which provides perspective on where and among whom attempted vote buying is more common. Grounding our expectations in extant literature, we analyze predictors of vote buying practices across 22 countries. The results affirm the importance of individual level poverty and, as well, country level income inequality in predicting offers of vote buying. In addition, the politically and civically engaged are more frequently targeted by vote buying efforts. Overall, the propensity to be targeted by clientelistic offers is greater in unequal contexts and among individuals that provide greater marginal pay off to offers of material benefits in exchange for the vote.},

abstract = {This paper uses a transaction-costs framework to link the policymaking process (PMP) and the outer features of public policies in Mexico, a middle-income developing country. It shows how a highly secretive PMP, centralized around the presidency, fashioned nationalist policies that were stable, adaptable, coordinated and private-regarding for the urban-based corporatist pillars of the regime. When growth faltered in the late 1970s, however, this PMP was unable to adapt to economic volatility, although it remained dominant in an increasingly turbulent polity. The paper explains how unified government and corporatist control of the economy made a constitutionally weak president the envy of executives around the world, even at the cost of being unable to enact reforms with short-term costs for the corporatist pillars of the regime. The article also explains why democratization in the 1990s is giving rise to a less centralized and more open PMP that benefits larger shares of the population. As the separation of powers enshrined in the 1917 constitution materializes, policymaking is increasingly wedded to the status quo. On the one hand, divided government preserves a macroeconomic framework consistent with an open economy (such as fiscally sound policies and a floating exchange rate). On the other, checks and balances are helping old and new parties and interest groups to veto agreement on the raising of chronically low tax rates (at 10 percent of GDP) and on reforming nationalist policies that limit private sector investment in the state-controlled energy sector.},

abstract = {Researchers widely recognize that economic crises have important political consequences, yet there is little systematic research on the political factors that make nations more or less susceptible to economic crisis. Scholars have long debated the economic consequences of party systems, executive powers, and societal interest groups, but their relationships to crisis proclivity are poorly understood. We assess the political correlates of economic crisis using a cross-sectional time-series analysis of 17 Latin American countries over nearly three decades. Crises are measured along two dimensions-depth and duration-and disaggregated into three types: inflationary, GDP, and fiscal crises. Statistical results suggest that political institutions have a modest, and often unexpected, correlation with crises. More important than institutional attributes are social organization and the nature of party-society linkages, particularly the existence of a densely-organized trade union movement and/or a powerful leftist party. Strong unions and powerful parties of the left are associated with more severe economic crises, though there is some evidence that the combination of left-labor strength can alleviate inflationary crises. The results demonstrate the need to disaggregate the concept of economic crisis and incorporate the societal dimension when studying the political economy of crisis and reform.

abstract = {Policy diffusion studies often invoke explanations that draw on the directional pressures for emulation, whether top-down, horizontal, or bottom-up. This article develops a theoretical framework that accounts for the multidirectional features of diffusion, including sub-national, cross-national, and international mechanisms, through the illustrative case of Brazil's federal adoption of Bolsa Escola (School Grant Program), a conditional cash transfer program that preceded the internationally acclaimed poverty alleviation program called Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia (Family Grant Program). Using process tracing, I argue that bottom-up pressures, including professional norms and intergovernmental competition, were key for policy emulation. Cross-national competition had little effect on decision-making. Finally, top-down processes, including norms and financing, reinforced adoption decisions and ensured these programs would endure. {\textcopyright}The Author 2011.

abstract = {A large strand of research holds that democracy with its broad representation and electoral accountability is beneficial for the provision of public goods. Yet, there is a large variation in how democracies perform, indicating that democratic institutions alone do not suffice for securing citizens' wellbeing. Recent studies have stressed the equal importance of state capacity for public goods delivery. These studies, however, rarely investigate how the lack of state capacity mutes the effects of democratic institutions on public goods provision. This article addresses this gap by using a mixed methods design. First, the conditional effects of democracy and quality of government (QoG) are tested on the previously under-researched domain of the provision of clean water. The results show that democracy is associated with higher water quality only in countries where QoG is high. If QoG is low, more democracy is even related to lower water quality. The second stage of the analysis proceeds by examining how poor QoG disrupts the effects of democracy on public access to safe drinking water using interview data from a typical case of Moldova. The analysis illustrates that democracy has a number of positive effects and incentivises politicians to focus on the visible aspects of water provision, including the expansion of the water pipe network. However, low QoG hampers adoption and implementation of long-term policies necessary for securing an aspect of water provision that is harder to achieve - namely water quality. This leaves the fresh pipes with dirty water.},
